          Automatically generated PR to update locked environment files for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

          These files were generated using conda-lock for improved dependency resolution and reproducibility.

          **Note: Do not merge without manual test execution. Either update the branch to trigger tests, or use `workflow_dispatch` to run tests manually. Unlike standard PRs, tests will not run automatically.**
