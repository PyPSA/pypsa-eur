**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

As the EU shifts away from the traditional energy
system and heads towards a decentralised, digitalised
and decarbonised transition, new and smart solutions
are required to manage the ever-increasing variable
generation mix whilst maintaining affordability and security
of supply. Demand-side flexibility (DSF), the ability of
customers to change their consumption and generation
patterns based on external signals, is a crucial element
in achieving these goals.

With the current geopolitical events causing skyrocketing
energy prices and supply risk disruptions, the need to
empower end-users to play an active part in securing and
decarbonising the EU energy system is gaining traction
in EU strategies and policies. However, the activation
of consumers’ flexibility still faces regulatory barriers,
notably due to the delayed implementation by Member
States of the Electricity Market Design. Furthermore,
DSF still lacks visibility as a reliable, efficient and climate-
friendly solution because its potential has never been
systematically quantified. This results in DSF being a
frequently overlooked solution in policy decisions,
hindering its potential in accelerating the cost-efficient
clean energy transition.

In order to fill this gap, smartEn – Smart Energy Europe,
commissioned an expert study from DNV to quantify
the potential benefits of a full deployment of DSF in the
EU by 2030. This DNV study intends to inform policy
decisions on how to achieve a 55% GHG reduction by
2030 in a cost-efficient way for both the whole energy
system and consumers.

In a full-DSF activation scenario that unleashes the
flexibility from buildings, electric vehicles and industry,
the following results are found:

**Wholesale benefits**

```
In the year 2030 the model estimates a total of 164 GW
upward flexible power^1 and 130 GW of downward flexible
power^2. With an activation of 397 terawatt hours (TWh)
of upward DSF and 340.5 TWh of downward DSF the
following results are found:
```
```
€4.6 billion (5%) are saved due to lower costs to
generate electricity compared to a scenario without DSF.
```
```
The power system could serve all demand all year
long, saving €9 billion on ‘lost load’ not served by the
available generation.
```
```
Renewable energy curtailment would be 15.5 TWh
(61%) less, improving the economics of renewables and
the availability of decarbonized electricity to consumers.
```
```
37.5 million tonnes (Mt) would be saved in annual GHG
emission – i.e., 8%, nearly 84 kilos per capita, meaning
that the power sector could exceed the ‘55% by 2030’
target.
```
```
Benefits for security of
supply
```
```
The modelling suggests that the energy system in
2030 would lack at least 60 GW of generation capacity
to ensure security of supply during the highest demand
peaks. Load shifting and load curtailment would allow
the system to maintain security of supply by fulfilling the
lack of generation capacity.
```
```
Enabling 60 GW of DSF would save €2.7 billion annually
compared to installing 60 GW of peak generation capacity.
```
```
Activating DSF technologies in European balancing
markets in 2030 could save a total of €262–690 million
across the EU27, a balancing energy cost saving of 43%
to 66%.
```
1. Upward DSF means increase of generation or decrease of demand.
2. Downward DSF means decrease of generation or increase of demand.


```
DEMAND-SIDE FLEXIBILITY IN THE EU: Quantification of benefits in 2030
```
```
“Demand-side flexibility” means the capability of any active customer to react to external signals and
adjust their energy generation and consumption in a dynamic time -dependent way, individually as well
as through aggregation.
```
```
Demand -side flexibility can be provided by smart decentralised energy resources, including demand
management, energy storage, and distributed renewable generation to support a more reliable,
sustainable and efficient energy system.
```
What is Demand-side flexibility?

- the smartEn definition

**Benefits for the distribution**

**grid**

**€11.1–29.1 billion** would be saved in investment
needs at EU 27 annually between 2023 and 2030. This
represents between **27% to 80%** of today’s forecasted
investment needs (between €253.1 billion and €282.
billion between 2023 and 2030 in investments in low-
and medium voltage distribution grids to integrate new
loads and RES capacity).

**Benefits for consumers**

The full deployment of DSF will translate into direct
benefits for consumers with flexible assets, as well
as indirect benefits to all customers through cheaper
electricity prices and lower grid costs:

```
Direct benefits could lead to a potential cost reduction
for consumers of more than €71 billion (64%) per year
on electric consumption.
```
```
Over €300 billion in indirect annual benefits to people,
communities, and businesses would result from reductions
in energy prices as a whole, generation capacity costs,
investment needs for grid infrastructure, system balancing
costs, and carbon emissions.
```
```
This DNV study is a timely addition to the growing, but
still limited, corpus of detailed research into the potential
benefits of DSF to achieve the ultimate goals of providing
secure, accessible supplies of affordable clean energy to
all consumers in the EU27. The findings serve as a clear
warning to not undervalue DSF given its huge potential
impact toward an efficient, clean electricity system.
```

The input data and assumptions in the wholesale market simulation model are based largely on the Fit
for 55 objectives and REPowerEU. Drawing on these, DNV has defined inputs – divided into generation
mix, electricity demand, DSF technologies and CO2 emission target. DNV’s complex model assesses
monetary values of system-level savings and end-user benefits on the wholesale market from a full
activation of DSF.

The study explores two scenarios, ‘DSF’ and ‘no-DSF’, the latter providing a reference against which to
compare costs, benefits, emissions, and other outputs. Both have the same amount of flexible assets,
but in the DSF scenario these assets are fully price-elastic. In the no-DSF scenario, distributed flexible
assets are fully price-inelastic, though larger assets (electrolysers, front-of-meter batteries and central
generators) are fully price-elastic in both scenarios.

The estimated total benefit represents an order-of-magnitude value for the opportunity that could be
lost by failing to activate this level of flexibility.

DNV has performed calculations outside the model, using literature and simplified methodologies, to
estimate DSF benefits for adequacy, balancing and grid infrastructure costs.

### CONSIDERATIONS:

The model developed and applied for this study,
and its results, are constrained by limitations of data
quality, comparability, and availability across Member
States in the EU 27.

DNV also points to a lack of studies on the
quantification of infrastructural benefits of DSF,
suggesting that this is a signal for relevant stakeholders
to further investigate the topic.

The no-DSF scenario is an unrealistic one given that
flexibility is already activated to varying degrees in
several EU member states. The DNV study explains in
detail how this scenario has been carefully constructed
to allow a meaningful quantification of the potential
value of DSF to the energy system.

The model is an energy-only one, based on marginal
costs, in line with the current market functioning. The
model does not consider capital expenditure costs for
generation assets, batteries, electrolysers or DSF, except
for the quantification of the security-of-supply benefits.

```
Although DSF investments are substantially lower
than the other technologies mentioned, it is unclear
how much the full potential will develop on its own
```
- assuming all regulatory barriers are removed – or
whether additional incentives are needed, as we have
seen and continue to see for batteries, electrolysers,
and renewables.

```
The model did not take into account the positive
energy efficiency impact of DSF activations, nor
potential savings in TSO redispatch costs and TSO grid
reinforcement costs.
```
```
Benefits within the four segments (wholesale,
adequacy, balancing and distribution grids) have been
calculated separately. The total DSF benefits are lower
than the sum of the benefits per segment, due to the
close interaction of these four segments.
```
```
Gas prices considered in the model are moderate
compared to the exceptional 2022 levels.

DEMAND-SIDE FLEXIBILITY IN THE EU: Quantification of benefits in 2030
```
3. See: REPowerEU: affordable, secure and sustainable energy for Europe | European Commission (europa.eu)

The use of Demand-Side Flexibility (DSF) in our European power system has been advocated for many years as a
crucial tool that empowers consumers to help integrate renewable energy sources in the energy system, and to
increase the overall efficiency of system development and day-to-day operations. More DSF deployment should
result in having more flexibility in the system at times of peak electricity demand, thereby reducing the need for
more expensive sources of power generation to remain available and be dispatched and thus reducing the overall
prices to consumers. Additionally, DSF could help to reduce the need for power grid investments, since the availability
and deployment of more flexibility on the demand side can help to reduce strain on critical components and/or
connections in the grid. This is especially so in light of the fundamental system change in which fully controllable,
fossil-based power plants are rapidly being replaced by renewable energy sources, whose production is largely
determined by weather conditions.

Consumers, however, largely consider electricity to be a commodity that they consume whenever they need it. Being
more flexible in the way they consume their power is typically not something they are concerned about, largely
because most consumers pay a fixed price per kilowatt-hour (kWh) to their retail supplier.

To advance insights on what DSF can mean for the (transition of the) European power system, smartEn commissioned
a study from DNV, aimed at quantitatively assessing the potential benefits of a full deployment of DSF in the EU 27
Member States by the year 2030.

**1.1. Context**

Although DSF has been earmarked as an important
source of power system flexibility, its actual contribution
to current system operations and the power market
remains largely unknown. Even though EU directives and
regulations aim to stimulate a more widespread adoption
and market participation, overall contributions (responding
to system needs that are reflected through market prices)
appear to remain limited. Ahead of this study into EU-
wide benefits, there are no (public) sources available
that have investigated overall availability, deployment
and/or pricing of DSF across EU 27 nations. Some of the
available publications provide more detailed insight into
the possible contributions of specific forms of demand
response, benefits for specific countries, or contributions
to cost savings in specific areas (e.g. grids in a specific
country).

```
In the context of the Fit for 55 package and the associated
efforts that Member States are undertaking to achieve
55% greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions by
2030, DSF may have a key role in providing the flexibility
needed to allow for this objective to become a reality.
In addition, recent events such as the war in Ukraine,
and aggravated climate concerns, are driving a (much)
quicker phase-out of the use of (Russian) gas and a
ramp-up of emission reduction targets. These updated
goals are incorporated into the European Commission’s
REPowerEU Communication and the emergency electricity
market design interventions.^3 These updated strategies
also include a vast expansion of distributed flexible assets
and requirements for their activation, intended to be
able to serve even more of Europe’s energy needs with
renewably generated power.
```
# 1. INTRODUCTION


**1.2. Purpose of this study**

The purpose of this study is to assess the potential benefits
of DSF to the European power system in the year 2030,
where all renewable energy sources (RES) targets and
55% GHG reduction are achieved, assuming that DSF
can access all markets throughout the EU 27. The project
team has developed and executed an approach to be
able to identify:

```
The DSF capacities that can be available in 2030
```
```
The DSF volumes that would be utilised to optimise
the wholesale market in 2030
```
```
How system-wide DSF benefits translate into
benefits for consumers
```
```
The potential impact that DSF activations have on
wholesale, adequacy, system balancing and grid
infrastructure
```
Although the study addresses all areas – wholesale
market, system balancing, and infrastructure – the focus
of the approach and modelling is on wholesale because
the potential impact was foreseen to be much larger.
Throughout the study, ‘wholesale’ is defined as forward,
day-ahead and intraday electricity markets (explicitly
excluding balancing markets / ancillary services).

**1.3. Approach**

Specific industry insights about technology developments
and policy targets are combined with those from available
public sources on the availability and impacts of DSF-
technologies, such as reports by Eurelectric, ENTSO-E
and individual TSOs such as RTE (France), Elia (Belgium),
E-Bridge and DNV. These inputs and datasets, and
contributions by smartEn members, made up the inputs
for this study.

Electricity wholesale market benefits are assessed by
using these (additional) DSF options as input to wholesale

```
market simulations in a ‘DSF scenario’ for 2030 in DNVs
European Market Model, an economic dispatch simulation
model to simulate power markets. Results are compared
against a ‘no-DSF scenario’ that assumes no flexibility to
be available from the DSF-technologies whose impacts
are assessed in this report (see 2.3.1 for a list of the
selected DSF technologies). This comparison shows
differences between the two scenarios in terms of reaching
emission reduction targets and the costs for generation
and consumption. It should be noted that the no-DSF
scenario is not realistic and is not a counterfactual, but
rather a reference to calculate the maximum achievable
potential.
```
```
Benefits for the balancing market and grid development
are approximated based upon deductions from various
sources, e.g. departing from specific grid savings in a
single Member State. Although this may be assessed in
much more detail later (e.g. by assessing the specific grid
situation and challenges to overcome in each Member
State and at every grid level), the project team expected
benefits in wholesale trading and adequacy to be much
larger due to sheer trading volumes across all EU 27
Member States. Therefore, a thorough analysis has first
been performed on these two aspects.
```
```
Further details about our approach and its limitations
are provided in chapter 2 and Appendix A.
```
**1.4. Structure of this report**

```
Chapter 2 provides further details of the approach
regarding wholesale market simulations in two different
scenarios (DSF and no-DSF). Chapter 3 discusses the
results of the market simulations regarding the different
DSF-technologies. Overall benefits in terms of wholesale
benefits, emission reductions, generation adequacy,
balancing and grid development across the EU 27 are
the focus of chapter 4. Chapter 5 assesses the resulting
consumer benefits. Finally, chapter 6 provides an overview
of DNVs main conclusions and recommendations.

Appendix A provides further detail about the approaches
to quantify the impacts of DSF in the various areas
(wholesale, balancing and grid development).

```
DEMAND-SIDE FLEXIBILITY IN THE EU: Quantification of benefits in 2030
```
The main focus of this study is the analysis of the potential wholesale benefits of DSF use in the European power
system in 2030. This focus was based on the assumption that, out of the four main value drivers (wholesale, adequacy,
balancing and grid infrastructure), the first inhibits the highest potential for DSF to valorise – an assumption that is
confirmed by the outcome of this study. To quantify these potential wholesale benefits of DSF use, DNV modelled
the European power market considering the different DSF options available in 2030.

DNV has used its European Market Model, a fundamental market model that simulates the day-ahead spot price by
optimising the unit commitment and economic dispatch of electricity generation. The simulations are performed
on an hourly time-resolution containing a detailed representation of generation, commodity prices and demand
for all bidding zones in EU 27 Member States, based on the following modelling assumptions:

Finally, the input data and assumptions included in the model are focused on the Fit for 55 objectives (European
Commission , 2021) and REPowerEU Communication (European Commission, 2022). Considering these guidelines,
DNV has defined the inputs to the European Market Model, which can be divided into generation mix, electricity
demand, DSF technologies and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission target.

Generation capacities are modelled on an individual
basis with detailed techno-economic characteristics
such as, but not limited to, heat rates, ramping ability,
minimum stable level, fuel cost, other variable operating
costs, maintenance and forced outage rates, etc.

Renewable generation takes volatility into account
through the use of historical or re-analysed time series
of, for example, data on wind speed and solar irradiation
for different locations. These profiles take geographical
correlation into account.

Market exchanges between countries (i.e. bidding
zones) are defined based on Net Transfer Capacities. The
increase in available transmission capacity is based on
available projections announced by individual TSOs and/
or ENTSO-E. Transmission and distribution constraints
within bidding zones are not modelled.

The demand consists of an hourly fixed demand profile,
flexible demand-side management components and other
flexible load originated by front-of-the-meter applications
such as utility-scale batteries. Flexible demand is optimised

```
against certain constraints within the model (see Appendix
A – section 1.1.2) – e.g. electric vehicles (EVs) need to
be charged by a certain volume within a specified period
(e.g. during the night or within one week).
```
```
The model set-up assumes that all flexible demand and
generation, both front and behind-the-meter, is exposed
to the market.
```
```
The commodity prices are set at a “normal’ level
excluding exceptional situations such the Ukrainian war as
well as the low availability of the French nuclear portfolio.
```
```
Network tariffs and taxation are not included in the
model. As a consequence, there is no explicit optimisation
of (collective ) self-consumption. In practice, this effect
is implicit to the system behaviour. For example, if a
residential customer has both rooftop PV and a battery,
then the battery (being exposed to market prices) will
typically charge when high amounts of PV energy are
produced – yielding a similar result as self-consumption
optimisation.
```
## INPUT AND SET-UP OF

# 2. THE MARKET MODEL


**2.1. CO2 emission target**

```
Fit for 55 establishes the target of reducing net GHG emissions for all Member States by at least 55% by 2030,
compared with 1990 levels. DNV translated this target into the equivalent of 410 million tonnes (Mt) of CO2 emissions
in the EU power sector by 2030. This CO2 emission target is based on the result of DNV’s Energy Transition Outlook
model (DNV, 2021). This target was used as a benchmark to evaluate the ability of the 2030 scenario, and DSF in
particular, to help reach the Fit for 55 target.
```
**2.2. Generation capacity mix**

```
Considering the EU 27 Member States, the generation capacity mix in 2030 is characterised mainly by a high share
of renewables, reaching 75% renewable installed capacity. Thermal installed capacity is reduced to less than 25% of
the generation portfolio, as seen in Figure 1. Gas-fired generation is the main thermal source^4 , while coal and lignite
generation are significantly reduced. The development of generation installed capacities are in line with the targets
presented in REPowerEU and Fit for 55 for an increase in renewable energy production, an increment of renewable
hydrogen production, and a consequent decrease in GHG emissions. In particular, installed solar PV capacity (front
and behind the meter) in EU 27 reaches 600 GW by 2030 as defined in the REPowerEU Plan. Moreover, offshore
wind capacities in the North-Sea are increased based on the latest targets agreed by Belgium, Denmark, Germany
and the Netherlands, reaching 65 GW by 2030 (BMWK, 2022).
```
**2.3. Electricity demand**

```
The electricity demand is considered in the analysis by differentiating the traditional demand for electricity from
the additional demand due to the electrification of passenger transport and heating, and from electrolysers for
power-to-hydrogen conversion.
```
```
Traditional demand encompasses, for example, household, commercial and industrial power demand, categories
already considered nowadays. This segment of demand reaches 2858 TWh across EU 27 Member States in 2030.
```
```
Electrification of passenger transport^5 is driven by support schemes and by technological and infrastructure
developments and expected cost degression. This creates demand for 151 TWh of electricity in 2030.
```
4. Gas prices are assumed to decrease by 2030. The model considers a gas price of 25.3 €/MWhth in 2030.
5. In our model this is limited to passenger EVs.

DEMAND-SIDE FLEXIBILITY IN THE EU: Quantification of benefits in 2030
```
7. European Commission assumptions are a utilisation factor of 43% and electrolyser efficiency of 70%.
6. Water heating is not included.

```
Electrification of heating consists of both space heating and industrial heating, accounting for 510 TWh by 2030.^6
```
```
Power-to-hydrogen entails the electricity demand required by electrolysers. The electrolysers’ demand increases
significantly in 2030 to reach the targeted 10 Mt of renewable hydrogen production in Europe, based on the REPowerEU
Communication. Therefore, using European Commission assumptions and according to DNV calculations, 562 TWh
of electricity consumption for hydrogen production is expected in 2030.^7
```
**2.3.1. DSF TECHNOLOGIES**

```
To quantify the potential benefits of demand-side
flexibility, DNV has modelled DSF technologies as part
of the European power system used in the analysis.
Based on the technology characteristics and high
flexible power potential, DNV included the following
DSF technologies:
```
```
Smart charging
```
```
Vehicle-to-grid
```
```
Behind-the-meter (BTM) batteries
```
```
Industrial demand-side response (DSR)
```
```
Residential space electric heating
```
```
Industrial electric heating
```
```
District heating – combined heat and power (CHP)
```
```
Industrial heating – CHP
```
```
Other DSF technologies with relevant potential were not
included in the list for this study, due to unavailability
of sufficient data to assess their availability throughout
EU 27 by 2030. These include, for example, district
cooling, residential cooling, Joule effect electric heating,
and residential electric boilers. To mitigate the risk of
overestimating total DSF capacities that are available
to the power system in 2030, DNV has decided to not
incorporate these technologies into the study.
```
```
Finally, behind-the-meter solar PV is also considered in
the model. However, it is not modelled as a controllable
asset but as non-curtailable PV generation.

**Smart charging and vehicle-to-grid**

Electric vehicles are included in the analysis and considered
as DSF technologies that can provide flexibility by shifting
their load. Smart charging is modelled by optimising the
total daily EV demand when EVs are connected to the grid.
For a detailed description of smart-charging modelling
and references refer to Appendix A – section 1.1.2.3.

A total of around 60 million EVs by 2030 are included for
the 27 Member States.

Additionally, DNV assumed that 30% of the EV chargers are
enabled for bidirectional charging (European Commission,
Directorate-General for Energy, 2022). Bidirectional ch
arging or vehicle-to-grid (V2G) enables the EV battery
to feed in to the grid as well as charging. As such, V2G is
modelled as behind-the-meter battery whose charging
and discharging is limited by the EVs that are connected
to the grid. For detailed description of V2G modelling and
references refer to Appendix A – section 1.1.2.4.

**Behind-the-meter batteries**

BTM batteries provide flexibility through charging and
discharging daily when prices show a sufficient spread to
cover their efficiency and operational costs. For detailed
description of Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)
modelling and references refer to Appendix A - section
1.1.2.2. In this study, DNV has considered a total of 10.
GW of BTM batteries in the EU 27.

**Industrial demand-side response**

Industrial DSR is considered a curtailable load. The load
would curtail above a given electricity price that varies
per category and is based on the cost that the industrial
plant would incur when interrupting its operation. For
detailed description of industrial DSR modelling and
references refer to Appendix A – section 1.1.2.1. A total
of 21.7 GW of industrial DSR capacity is included across
all Member States.

```
Residential electric heating
```
```
In the model, all flexible residential electric heating is
assumed to be provided by heat pumps and is considered
a shiftable load within 12-hour periods. Therefore, the
half-daily load required for residential electric heating
is met, but the hours when the consumption take place
can shift overtime. For detailed description of residential
electric heating modelling and references refer to Appendix
A – section 1.1.2.5. In order to represent this load, DNV
has considered a total space heating electricity demand
of 449 TWh by 2030.
```
```
Industrial electric heating^8
```
```
Industrial electric heating (e-boilers) is considered a
curtailable load. The load would curtail above a given
electricity price based on the cost that the industrial plant
would incur when switching off the e-boiler. For detailed
description of industrial electric heating modelling and
references refer to Appendix A – section 1.1.2.6. DNV
has considered 7 GW of industrial heating load across
all Member States.
```
```
District heating – CHP
```
```
District heating – CHP is considered as aggregated CHP
plants with a daily generation requirement. This DSF
technology behaves as a generator that can always deviate
upwards from their daily generation requirement, but can
only deviate downwards when it is more optimal to pay
a penalty than to generate (the penalty price is based on
the alternative cost for heating). For detailed description
of CHP modelling and references refer to Appendix A –
section 1.1.2.8. DNV has included a total of 56 GW of CHP
district heating capacity in EU 27 by 2030.
```
```
Industrial heating – CHP
```
```
Industrial heating – CHP is represented as CHP plants with
specific daily generation requirements. This technology
is modelled following the same logic as district heating –
CHP, with different generation requirements and penalties.
For detailed description of CHP modelling and references
refer to Appendix A – section 1.1.2.7. DNV has included a
total of 19 GW of industrial CHP capacity by 2030.

DEMAND-SIDE FLEXIBILITY IN THE EU: Quantification of benefits in 2030
```
**2.3.2. OTHER FLEXIBLE TECHNOLOGIES**

The following technologies are included in the model as flexible technologies but are not considered as demand-side
flexibility because they are not placed behind the meter. The flexibility that these technologies provide is therefore not
included in the DSF capacities and their possible benefits that this study sets out to quantify. At the same time, since
these technologies are actively participating in the electricity market, they do influence the outcome of this study.

**2.4. Reference scenario (no-DSF)**

To evaluate the outcomes of the model and derive the potential DSF contribution, it is necessary to set a reference
against to which to compare costs, emissions, and other parameters.

Lack of data on the DSF utilised today, and on DSF utilisation prospects towards 2030, makes it impossible to quantify
the counterfactual system costs. Therefore, DNV modelled a 2030 scenario in which the demand side is not flexible.
Realising that demand-side technologies are to some extent – and in some Members States more than others –
already actively participating in the electricity market, DNV acknowledges that the reference scenario is not a realistic
one. The main purpose is to quantify the total potential benefit of DSF for the considered technologies. If there are
still certain barriers in 2030 to DSF responding to external price signals, a certain share of this potential will not be
achieved. The total benefit provides an order-of-magnitude value of this missed opportunity (albeit an upper bound).

The no-DSF scenario considers the same amount of DSF technologies (e.g. the same amount of EVs), yet all DSF
technologies have a fixed demand/generation profile and therefore show no price responsiveness – i.e. they provide
no flexibility to the system.

The no-DSF scenario does include the same amount of other flexibility sources that are not considered to be DSF,
mainly electrolysers and front-of-the-meter storage. These flexible resources are price responsive and are treated
as such in the no-DSF scenario.

Throughout the report the reference scenario in which DSF technologies are not flexible is referred to as the ‘no-
DSF’ scenario; and the scenario in which DSF technologies are flexible is referred as the ‘DSF scenario’.
The table 2.1 provides a summary of the implementation of the DSF and no-DSF scenarios. The detailed description
of the modelling of both scenarios is included in Appendix A – section 1.1.2.

9. This capacity value was calculated based on the targeted renewable hydrogen production in REPowerEU and its reported assumptions.

**Grid-connected storage**

Grid-connected batteries provide flexibility through
charging and discharging daily when prices show a
sufficient spread to cover their efficiency and operational
costs. For detailed description of BESS modelling and
references refer to Appendix A – section 1.1.2.2. In this
study, DNV has considered a total of 15.5 GW of front-
of-the meter batteries in EU 27.

```
Electrolysers
```
```
Electrolyser consumption is considered as a flexible load.
The load would curtail above a given electricity price
based on the cost of hydrogen, this is estimated at 86.
€/MWh. For detailed description of electrolyser modelling
and references refer to Appendix A – section 1.1.2.9.
Installed capacities and annual consumptions are based
on the REPowerEU Communication’s indicative targets
of 10 mt renewable hydrogen annual production, which
may translate to up to 149 GW in total for all Member
States by 2030.^9

DEMAND-SIDE FLEXIBILITY IN THE EU: Quantification of benefits in 2030
```
This section presents the results on quantification of DSF in 2030, based on wholesale optimisation. First, the total
flexible power and activated flexibility is reported at EU 27 level. Then, the modelling of flexibility and its quantification
approach is detailed per technology.

**3.1. DSF available power and activated flexibility**

**DSF available power**

Based on the inputs and outputs of the market model, there is a total of 164 GW upward flexible power and 130
GW of downward flexible power in 2030. Considering 752 GW of peak demand of the EU 27 system in 2030, the
upward and downward flexible power represents about 22% and 17% of the peak demand, respectively.

Table 3.1 summarises the available flexible power per technology, on average in 2030. It shows both upward flexibility
(increasing generation or reducing demand) and downward flexibility (decreasing generation or increasing demand).

It should be noted that the way the flexible power is calculated varies per technology. This is because the technologies
are flexible in different ways, e.g. smart charging available power is not constant but depends on the number of
cars connected to chargers that have available battery capacity.

## DEMAND-SIDE FLEXIBILITY

# 3. PROVIDED IN 2030


**Activated flexibility**

DNV calculated the amount of flexibility that was activated as a result of the 2030 electricity (wholesale) market
simulation that optimises the system behaviour. The results indicate that a total of 397 TWh and 340 TWh of upward
flexibility and downward flexibility, respectively, are activated in 2030 within EU 27. Considering 4,081 TWh of total
demand in 2030, the upward and downward activated flexibility corresponds to about 10% and 8% of the total
demand, respectively.

Table 3.2 summarises the total activated flexibility broken down per DSF technology. **The results show that the
largest part of activated flexibility in both directions is supplied by residential electric heating, followed by EVs,
CHPs supplying district heating, and V2G.**

The next subsections include a more detailed description of the model results and the calculation of flexible power
and activated flexibility per technology.

**3.2. Industrial DSR**

All energy generated by industrial DSR assets is considered
upward flexibility as it corresponds to a reduction in
demand. When the entire cheaper generation capacity
is already fully committed, industrial DSR acts as a last
resort to prevent unserved load. The results of the model
show that the average price of activated industrial DSR
is below 550 €/MWh in all Member States except in two
Member States, where more expensive categories are
also activated sometimes.

To illustrate the realised capacity provided by industrial
DSR, the load duration curve of industrial DSR activation
is included below (Figure 3). The load duration curve
shows the duration (% of the hours in a year; x-axis) of
deployment of a certain load level (MW; y-axis) throughout
all the 8,760 hours of 2030. It can be observed that
the cheapest industrial DSR option (i.e. 207 €/MWh) is
the most frequently activated, about 500 hours in one
year for the whole EU 27, whereas the most expensive
category (i.e. 1,097 €/MWh) is activated for less than 1%
of the time. Overall, the total activated upward flexibility
is 1,071 GWh.
```

```
DEMAND-SIDE FLEXIBILITY IN THE EU: Quantification of benefits in 2030
```
**3.3. BESS – Behind the meter**

All energy either supplied or consumed by behind-the-
meter batteries is considered upward or downward
flexibility, respectively. The total activated upward flexibility
is 637 GWh, whereas the total activated downward
flexibility is 871 GWh. The difference between upward and
downward flexibility is due to charging and discharging
inefficiencies.

For this technology, the flexible power is calculated
the installed capacity. This capacity is available in both
directions, charge and discharge.

```
One can see in Figure 4 an illustrative example of the
operation of behind-the-meter BESS in one week of
2030 in Germany. The batteries follow the market price:
when the price variations are large enough to overcome
operating inefficiencies and costs, the batteries charge
if the price has dropped, or discharge if the price has
increased. Note that this optimisation is done for one
day look-ahead, therefore sufficient price spread need
to be fulfilled during the same day.
```
```

```
```
Figure 4 – Example of behind-the-meter BESS (dis)charging during week 29 in Germany in 2030
```

**3.4. Smart charging**

The flexibility provided by EVs is calculated as the difference
between the optimised EV load given by the simulation
results and a fixed EV charging profile used as reference
in the no-DSF scenario, while respecting the total daily
load requirement. Upward flexibility is provided when
the optimised EV load is below the reference charging
profile, whereas downward flexibility is provided when
the optimised EV load is above the reference charging
profile. As such, the upward and downward flexible power

Downward activated flexibility absolute values are the same as the EV daily consumption per Member State is a
given input to the optimisation challenge. Overall, the total activated flexibility is 106.3 TWh in both directions.

Figure 6 illustrates an example of the behaviour of EVs in week 30 in Spain resulting from the market model. The
figure shows how the daily EV load is optimised against market prices while respecting the EV capacity available
each hour. As the daily EV fleet consumption is a required input of the model, the EVs charge every day, preferably
during hours of low prices. Additionally, the hourly maximum charging power is capped by the availability profile,
which is defined as the hourly charging capacity connected at private and office charging points.

```
is calculated as the average deviation from the reference
charging profile respectively.
```
```
To show the difference between the optimised smart
charging and a non-flexible EV charging behaviour, Figure
5 includes the resulting profile from the market model
against the non-flexible EV profile. The results correspond
to EVs during week 4 of 2030 in Spain.
```
```

EV charging profile of Spanish EVs during week 4 of 2030
```

```
DEMAND-SIDE FLEXIBILITY IN THE EU: Quantification of benefits in 2030
```
**3.5. V2G**

All energy either supplied or consumed by the EVs via V2G is considered upward or downward flexibility, respectively.
For this technology, the flexible power corresponds to the total charging point capacity with V2G capability (i.e.
30%) multiplied by the average utilisation factor (26.1%). Overall, the total upward flexibility is 21 TWh and the total
downward flexibility is 23.7 TWh. Load values are 12% higher due to charging/discharging inefficiencies.

One can see an illustrative example of the behaviour of V2G in a week in the Netherlands in 2030 in Figure 7. V2G
follows the market prices: when the price variations are large enough to overcome operating inefficiencies and
costs, the batteries charge if the price has dropped, or discharge if the price has increased, keeping the number of
daily cycles below or equal to 2. Additionally, the max charge or discharge power is constrained by the availability
profile (both consumption and feed-in) of charging points, as shown in Figure 8.

```
Figure 6 – Example of EVs charging in Spain during week 30 of 2030
```
```
Figure 7 – Example of V2G behaviour in the Netherlands during a week of 2030
```

**3.6. Residential electric heating**

The flexibility provided by residential electric heating is defined as the difference between the optimised load
given by the simulation results and the hourly profile used as reference in the no-DSF scenario. Upward flexibility
is provided when the optimised load is below the reference profile, whereas downward flexibility is provided when
the optimised load is above the reference profile. As such, the upward and downward flexible power is determined
by the average respective deviation from the reference hourly profile.

An Illustrative comparison between the ‘optimised’ load and the reference profile of German residential electric
heating during week 11 of 2030 in the DSF scenario is shown in Figure 9. One can see that the load is preferably
supplied in hours with low power prices, while fulfilling the 12-hour consumption requirement.

For all EU 27, the total activated flexibility is 195.5 TWh in both directions.

```

within feed-in and load availability profiles
```
```
Figure 9 – Example of residential electric heating in Germany during week 11 of 2030
```

```
DEMAND-SIDE FLEXIBILITY IN THE EU: Quantification of benefits in 2030
```
Several studies show that demand response, when applied to (residential) electric heating, also leads to energy
efficiency; the total energy used will be lower than the counterfactual (no DSF). This is an important upside, as it
leads to direct customer savings, lower demand (thus lower market prices), and carbon savings. The main reason
for not including this in our market modelling and quantification is the lack of empirical data that is both relevant
for the technology considered (heat pump) and representative for EU 27.

The flexibility provided by industrial electric heating is
determined by the difference between the non-flexible
industrial electric heating demand (fixed) profile and
the optimised demand profile given by the simulation
results. Upward flexibility is therefore provided when
the optimised demand is below the constant non-flexible
profile. As such, the upward flexible power is calculated
as the total installed capacity of flexible industrial load.

**3.7. Industrial electric heating**

```
Figure 10 – Example of industrial electric heating behaviour in Finland in week 1 of 2030
```
```
An illustrative comparison between the optimised load
and the reference profile of Finnish industrial electric
heating during week 1 of 2030 is shown in Figure 10.
One can see that the load is curtailed when the power
price rises above 500 €/MWh.
```
```
Overall, the total activated upward flexibility for EU 27
in 2030 is 140.7 GWh.
```
**3.8. Industrial heating – CHP**

Industrial heating – CHP is modelled as a CHP plant with
a power generation profile set at 100% of max capacity
between 05:00 and 20:00 hours, and at 65% otherwise.
Upward flexibility is, therefore, provided when the
generation is above the hourly target production, whereas
downward flexibility is provided when the generation is
below the hourly target production. As such, the upward
flexible power is calculated as the average deviation above
the hourly target production, whereas the downward
flexible power is defined as the average deviation below
the hourly target production.

Overall, the total activated upward and downward
flexibility are 12.7 TWh and 12 GWh, respectively.

**3.9. District heating – CHP**

```
District heating – CHP is modelled as aggregated CHP
plants with a daily generation requirement which is linked
to the daily heat demand. CHP units are defined as part
of a heating area for which they must fulfil certain level
of generation per day, which represents the required heat
consumption. Therefore, flexible power and flexibility
activation are calculated following the same method as
for industrial heating, namely CHPs.
```
```
The total activated upward and downward flexibility are
59.6 TWh and 14.0 TWh, respectively.
```

## QUANTIFICATION OF

## DSF BENEFITS IN 2030

**4.1. Wholesale markets and adequacy**

The underlying assumption of this study is that wholesale market benefits outweigh the potential DSF benefits such
as balancing or infrastructure savings, hence DNV’s main focus was on the modelling and methodology to derive
these market benefits. This section and the following ones prove that this assumption is correct and wholesale
market benefits are significantly higher than the rest.

To quantify the effect of the optimal DSF deployment on wholesale markets in EU 27, DNV has modelled and simulated
the European Power Market for the year 2030 (for the DSF and the no-DSF scenario), as described in section 2.^10 The
benefits were subsequently quantified by different metrics as the difference between the results for both scenarios:

```
Cost to generate:
```
These are the costs that generators/storage incur to cover the system demand. These include fuel costs, variable
operation and maintenance (VOM) costs, start and shutdown costs, emissions costs and penalties.^11

```
Loss of load:
```
This is the total amount of load that has not been served by the available generation. The cost used to monetise
the loss of load is set to 3,500 €/MWh. The actual valuation will strongly depend on the context, in particular the
degree of acceptability of load shedding and load curtailment as a mean of system adequacy.

```
Renewable energy curtailment:
```
This includes the curtailment of renewable energy generators for economic reasons and interconnector congestion
considerations.

```
Greenhouse gas emissions:
```
These are the total emissions by generators to cover the power demand.

```
Cost to serve load:
```
This is the total price that load needs to pay for their electricity intake. The price for the load is considered as the
day-ahead hourly spot price.

10. More details on the methodology and limitations of his methodology can be found in Appendix A – section 1.1
11. Penalties apply when a generator or a demand unit violates a constraint, e.g. a district heating CHP would pay a penalty when it generates less than the required production.

# 4.


```
DEMAND-SIDE FLEXIBILITY IN THE EU: Quantification of benefits in 2030
```
The results (Table 4.1) indicate that, in 2030, with the
activation of 397 TWh upward DSF and 340.5 TWh of
downward DSF:

The cost to serve load, i.e. the cost that consumers
pay for their electricity consumption, is around €301.5
billion (48%) less than in the no-DSF scenario;

The system meets and even exceeds the necessary
emission reduction in the power sector to fulfil the 55%
GHG reduction, whereas the no-DSF scenario does not
achieve the target;

The emissions are 37.5 million tonnes (8%) less than
in the no-DSF system;

Costs to generate are €4.6 billion (5%) less than in a
no-DSF system;

The system can serve all demand throughout the year,
whereas the no-DSF system cannot serve all the 2,054
GWh of load in 2030. Therefore, the DSF system saves
€9 billion on value of lost load; and

Renewable energy curtailment is 15.5 TWh (61%) less
than in the no-DSF scenario.

```
Cost to serve load benefits are significantly higher than the
rest of the parameters. This highlights the considerable
impact that load curtailment and load shifting have on
the generation mix for each moment. DSF avoids the
creation of high peaks where very expensive (and price
setting) generators are needed, and absorbs the energy in
the case of a generation surplus and relatively low prices.
Therefore, it can be observed that even if the generator
costs are only 5% less, the lower utilisation of expensive
generators makes a tremendous impact on the final cost
to load (nearly 50%).^12

The strong impact of DSF on the (residual) demand curve leads to a shift from generator’s surplus to consumer’s
surplus. When comparing the DSF to the no-DSF scenario, the larger part of the savings on the cost to serve can
therefore be attributed to the reduction of generator’s margins (which are, at least partly, required to cover the
initial investments). This impact is further specified in Table 4.2, which shows the total generation margins per type
of generation technology, for both scenarios. Since the no-DSF scenario is not realistic, these figures do not fully
describe the impact of full DSF deployment on the investment climate for different generation technologies. It does
indicate, however, which technologies are affected most when deploying DSF to its full potential:

Profitability of fossil fuel plants is very strongly impacted as both their running hours and market price volatility
are strongly reduced;

Profitability of nuclear plants is strongly impacted mainly due to reduced market price volatility, however nuclear
can benefit from the floor price already noticeable in the no-DSF scenario, see also Figure 11;

Profitability of renewables is somewhat impacted. However, the large amount of electrolysers and front-of-meter
storage already creates a floor price in the no-DSF scenario, and therefore the impact for renewables seems limited;

```
Profitability of biomass is strongly impacted, although less than fossil-fuel generators.
```
The impact of a full deployment of DSF on market price volatility is further demonstrated by the price duration
curves below.

DEMAND-SIDE FLEXIBILITY IN THE EU: Quantification of benefits in 2030
```
Both graphs clearly demonstrate that, whereas a price
floor already exists in the no-flex scenario (due to large
amounts of electrolysers and front-of-meter storage), the
DSF scenario further reduces price volatility, rendering a
relatively flat price duration curve for 2030.

**Adequacy considerations**

The analysis above shows that the no-DSF scenario does
not maintain security of supply, showing a loss load of
2,054 GWh. In terms of capacity, the no-DSF scenario
lacks up to 60 GW of generation capacity during the
highest peak in residual load. In the DSF scenario, the
system fulfils the lack of generation capacity with load
shifting and load curtailment.

While a full adequacy analysis was not the scope of this
study^13 , this analysis gives an indication of the minimum
gap (60 GW) that would need to be covered by additional
peak generation. Since the DNV model only considers
marginal costs, it does not quantify the capital expenditure
(CAPEX) benefits related to generation adequacy, i.e.
avoiding the construction of (in this case approximately
60 GW) additional capacity. Therefore, DNV calculated
an indicative adequacy benefit of DSF by comparing 1)
the investment required for installing 60 GW of peak
generation capacity; and 2) the costs of enabling 60 GW

```
of DSF. The difference between them is defined as the
DSF adequacy benefit. The following assumptions have
been made:
```
```
Additional generation capacity does not come
from carbon-free technologies, since there are more
cost-effective ways for decarbonising the system than
constructing carbon-free generators that run less than
100 hours per year. Therefore, the price of gas peaking
plants is considered.
```
```
For DSF, the costs of industrial DSF are considered,
as these are likely to play a dominant role in scarcity
situations. This is limited to the (annualised) enablement
costs of DSF. Typically, industrial customers also require
annual (capacity) payments for participating in services
with low activation frequencies. Because these payments
are direct benefits for consumers, they are not considered
as additional costs to consumers.
```
```
The table below gives a rough indication of the capital
investment needed for both options. The gas peaker
option is substantially more expensive than the investment
needed for installing 60 GW of DSF. Therefore, DNV
concludes that, roughly, the adequacy benefit of DSF
in 2030 is €2.7 billion.
```
13. An adequacy study needs stochastic modelling to draw statistically valid conclusions. The modelling used for this study was deterministic, and therefore not sufficient.

**4.2. System balancing**

DNV’s market model calculates day-ahead (DA) spot prices, and does not consider balancing energy and associated
costs. Therefore DNV has quantified the savings, that DSF could potentially bring to balancing markets by 2030,
following a simplified methodology presented in Appendix A – section 1.2. The quantification considers the difference
between energy balancing costs of the DSF and no-DSF scenarios in 2030. Given the relatively small size of balancing
markets compared to wholesale markets, DNV performed the calculation under four main assumptions:

**1.** By 2030, balancing energy will be procured at European level, not country level;
**2.** There is sufficient interconnection capacity so all balancing resources at European level are available to all Member
States, therefore assuming that current restrictions regarding excessive reliance on importations of balancing
services no longer apply;
**3.** Balancing capacity costs and balancing energy utilisation will remain at current levels; and
**4.** The balancing energy costs are determined by the marginal costs of technologies technically capable of providing
the different balancing services.

Under these assumptions, DNV first identified DSF and no-DSF technologies that could technically provide the
different balancing services and their associated marginal costs. DNV then built a merit order for each balancing
service for each scenario (DSF and no-DSF). Subsequently, based on the required balancing capacity, DNV identified
the technologies that would cover the balancing needs. Finally, the costs for balancing energy were calculated for
a full year based on the marginal costs of the technologies ‘in the money’ as well as the savings, i.e. the difference
in cost between scenarios.

DNV’s calculations showed that the participation of DSF technologies in European balancing markets in 2030 could
save, in total for EU 27, **between €262 million and €690 million.** In relative terms, this translates into a balancing
energy cost saving of between 43% and 66%. The wide range of savings is due to the uncertainties related to the
different balancing capacity needs for all EU 27 members. The different capacity needs correspond to different price
levels in the balancing merit order, which in turn translate into a wider saving range.

It is worth noting that one of the limitations of the approach is that the quantification does not consider opportunity
costs for participating in other markets. A more elaborate overview of the approach is presented in Appendix A –
Section 1.2.2.


```
DEMAND-SIDE FLEXIBILITY IN THE EU: Quantification of benefits in 2030
```
**4.3. Grid infrastructure**

As previously described in section 2, DNV’s market model does not include distribution grid restrictions or local
flexibility markets. Therefore, DNV has created a simplified methodology, based on the limited data available, to
quantify the required investments in distribution grids between 2023 and 2030 and the infrastructural benefits of
DSF. A detailed description of the methodology is presented in Appendix A – Section 1.1.
The methodology is built under these main assumptions:

**1.** All available DSF flexible power behaves in a grid-friendly manner. This means that flexibility responds to network
needs either through (collective) self-consumption, grid tariff optimisation or provision of flexibility services to
distribution system operators.
**2.** Distribution grid investments are mainly driven by final electricity demand, adoption of EVs and RES capacity.
**3.** The potential savings are proportional to the ratio of DSF available capacity and peak load.

In summary, this methodology consists of both a top-
down and bottom-up phase. In the former, the required
distribution grid investments at EU 27 level are calculated
and distributed across Member States according to their
share of electric load, electric vehicles, and RES capacity
connected to the distribution grid. In the latter, based on
available DSF capacity relative to peak load, savings in
infrastructural investments are estimated per Member
State and then aggregated at EU 27 level. Investments
required for the modernisation, digitalisation, automation,
and resilience of the distribution grids are not accounted
for.

According to (Eurelectric, 2021), investment needs
in distribution grids are mostly driven by the final
electricity demand, the number of electric vehicles,
and the renewable capacity connected to the distribution
grid.^14 Based on the input data, calculated DSF capacity
and the investment breakdown per driver derived from
(Eurelectric, 2021), DNV estimates that the EU 27 required
investments in distribution grids to integrate new loads
and RES capacity are between €253.1 billion and €282.5
billion between 2023 and 2030.

The results of the grid simulations in (E-Bridge, 2019)
show that the grid-friendly use of DSF capacity can reduce
by 76.9% the required investments in low-voltage and
medium-voltage distribution grid expansion in Germany
by 2035. Assuming a linear relation between DSF available

```
power and the investment savings, DNV estimates that
DSF can enable savings between €77.6 billion and €203.6
billion (i.e. between -27% and -80%) at EU 27 level
between 2023 and 2030. Assuming that the annual
investments are constant, the annual savings in 2030 are
estimated between €11.1 billion and €29.1 billion. The
large range of potential savings is due to the top-down
approach taken to quantify the grid investment needs
per Member State. This is due to the uncertainties on
the extent to which each country will contribute to the
total estimated investments, and hence to the benefits
enabled by available DSF.
```
```
The quantification approach proposed by DNV focuses
on the investments required in low-voltage and medium-
voltage distribution grids only and does not include
high-voltage grid or transmission grids. This means that
potential savings on transmission grid reinforcements
or DSF contribution to lowering redispatch costs have
not been quantified. Additionally, it does not consider
differences across countries regarding the current status
of development of the distribution grid and voltage level
in the distribution grid. A more elaborate overview of the
approach limitations is presented in Appendix A – section
1.3.3. Overall, DNV acknowledges the lack of studies on
the quantification of infrastructural benefits of DSF. DNV
interprets this as a signal for relevant stakeholders to
further investigate the topic.
```
14. These grid investment needs refer particularly to the needs raised by higher electrification and connection of renewables.


Here, the DSF benefits at system level calculated in the previous section are translated into benefits to the consumer.
Direct benefits end up at residential, commercial and industrial consumers with flexible loads, for example, EV
owners who exploit the flexibility of their EVs face lower energy costs when EV charging is exposed to dynamic
prices. Additionally, all consumers will gain indirect benefits, due to the overall effect on market prices.

**5.1. Direct benefits**

The direct benefits are those that the consumer sees
directly reflected in their energy bill^15 , as either a saving
or a revenue (e.g. batteries). Thus, these benefits can
be split per type of technology in 2030, which gives an
average indication of the savings per energy unit. DNV
calculated the savings/revenues depending on the type of
DSF technology, excluding capital investments for enabling
or acquiring the different DSF technologies:

Smart charging and space electric heating: The savings
are calculated as the difference between the cost to
source their required amount of energy in the DSF and
no-DSF scenarios in 2030.

Battery storage and V2G: The savings are calculated
as the difference between battery/V2G profits for both
scenarios in 2030. The profits are defined as the difference
in revenue generated by energy infeed and the costs
(charging and variable maintenance and operation costs).

Industrial electric heating: The savings are calculated
as the difference between the energy costs of both
scenarios. The difference in energy costs is caused by the
load curtailment in the DSF scenario and the different
energy prices.

Industrial DSR: The savings are calculated as the
reduction in energy costs due to curtailment minus the
cost incurred due to curtailment.

## QUANTIFICATION OF

# 5. CONSUMER BENEFITS

15. This is assuming that these customers are exposed to dynamic prices that reflect wholesale prices. Other remuneration models are also conceivable, e.g. fixed energy prices with a
separate remuneration for providing flexibility.

```
Table 5.1 includes a summary of direct benefits to
consumer.
```
```
The highest savings are achieved on space electric
heating with a potential cost reduction of €71 billion in
2030 for EU 27. These savings could be even greater when
taking energy-efficiency considerations into account. Some
studies indicate that residential flexibility activations also
accomplish a reduction of the overall load. For instance, an
RTE study (RTE, 2016) suggests that energy savings up to
50% could be achieved. However, DNV has not modelled
these aspects due to lack of evidence applicable to all
Member States throughout a full year.
```
```
An average EV owner could save up to 0.07 €/kWh,
which adds up to a saving of 176 €/year on their energy
bill in 2030. The average includes both smart charging
and V2G savings.
```
```
It can also be observed that behind-the-meter revenues
are significantly lower than the rest. Partly, this is due to
efficiency cost considerations.
```
```
Finally, industrial DSR figures show the savings that can
be achieved through (market-based) load curtailment
only, i.e. the reduction in total energy payment due to
different energy prices is not included in the calculations.

The changes in system costs and energy prices will have
an impact on all final consumers. The indirect potential
benefits that DSF provides to the consumer are:

The overall reduction of energy prices (i.e. the reduction
of cost to serve consumer’s load)
The reduction of generation capacity costs
The decrease in investment for grid infrastructure
The decrease of system balancing costs
The decrease of carbon emissions

Based on the results from the previous sections, Table
5.2 summarises the indirect impacts to all consumers,
in absolute terms and per capita. The results indicate
that the most significant saving is due to the reduction
of energy costs, **with an average reduction of €673.5 in
energy cost per capita in year 2030.** As previously detailed
in section 4.1, this is due to the effect of DSF in peak
shaving and reduction of renewable curtailment, which

```
avoids the use of more expensive generation. Following
the energy prices, and with a lower order of magnitude,
are infrastructure savings per year, representing €27.8 to
€65 per capita in year 2030. The savings with the lowest
impact are balancing services, at €0.7 to €1.6 per capita
in year 2030; these savings are relatively low because the
size of the market is significantly smaller compared with
wholesale. Finally, one of the benefits for all consumers
is the lowering of carbon emissions by 83.8 kg per capita,
which would fulfil the 55% reduction by 2030.
```
```
Whereas end consumers benefit from reduced electricity
market prices, generators will substantially lose margin
on their transactions. This effect is the strongest for
fossil, nuclear and biomass power plants; the impact for
renewables is substantially less as these can also benefit
from additional load during times of high renewable
generation. An overview of generator margins and further
considerations in the implications are presented in section 4.1.
```
16. Savings per capita are calculated for 447.7 million inhabitants in EU 27 (eurostat, 2020).
17. It should be noted that the reference for the calculation of infrastructure benefits is not the ‘no DSF’ scenario. This is due to the methodology applied to this
calculation. The savings and relative calculation are based on the investments needed as predicted today in a business-as-usual situation.

```
Table 5.2 – Indirect consumer benefits
```
**5.2. Indirect benefits**


**5.3. Stackability considerations**

In its methodology, DNV has assessed the value of DSF in the different segments separately, – i.e. wholesale, generation adequacy,
balancing and infrastructure. Analysis shows that the potential value is significant, especially for the costs to serve load.
This study assumes that all DSF technologies have access to these segments and will be activated based on a market-based
mechanism – provided that they meet the technical requirements (mainly balancing) and geographical requirements (mainly
infrastructure).

For estimating the total value of DSF, the three separate outcomes cannot simply be added. Although ‘value-stacking’ (participating
in different markets at the same time) of DSF in general is allowed, there are clear physical limitations to this concept, for example:

If a flexible EV charger is charging at maximum capacity due to low wholesale prices, it cannot increase its load to provide
balancing power (it can only provide balancing power in one direction in this case).

More delicate is the combination of wholesale and infrastructure. The deployment of DSF can improve both segments at the
same time but can also create conflicts. Considering the same EV charging example:

Optimising EV charging against wholesale prices will reduce EV charging load during late-afternoon peak hours, reducing the
stress on grid infrastructure in (urban) load centres;

Optimising EV charging against wholesale prices will increase EV charging during periods around noon with high solar-PV
power production, reducing the need for (market) PV curtailment, but increasing the stress on grid infrastructure in solar-PV
dominated (rural) areas.

The DNV model has not taken any limitations on the distribution grid into account. This means that when DSF is deployed to
reduce infrastructure costs, this will lower the benefits for the cost to serve load. Since the potential benefits on infrastructure
are significant, albeit lower than benefits for the cost to serve load, there is a compelling reason to look for the middle ground
of market and infrastructure optimisation. Using a proper market design, where all DSF not only is exposed to market prices as
well as cost-reflective grid fees and DSO flexibility services, can ensure that the benefits for the customer are optimal, and will
exceed the value of benefits to the cost to serve load only.

Generation adequacy benefits have been calculated outside the wholesale model by considering CAPEX costs of generation
assets that would be needed to solve the generation deficiency of the no-DSF scenario. Including these assets for the no-DSF
scenario within the model would lower the calculated wholesale benefits.

While the above categories are all potential benefits of DSF, they are not stackable and therefore the benefits cannot be simply
summed up to a total. The next section provides further insight on how these results can be interpreted.


```
DEMAND-SIDE FLEXIBILITY IN THE EU: Quantification of benefits in 2030
```
In 2030, the activation of 397 TWh upward DSF and 340.5
TWh of downward DSF enables Fit for 55 and REPowerEU
strategy by 2030 while achieving a cost reduction on:

```
Wholesale and adequacy
```
- The cost to serve load is up to around **€301.5 billion**
(48%) less;
- The emissions are up to **37.5 Mt** (8%) less;
- Costs to generate are up to **€4.6 billion** (5%) less;
- Renewable energy curtailment is up to **15.5 TWh**
(61%) less; and
- The costs saved on installed generation capacity are
up to **€2.7 billion** less.

Balancing energy costs are estimated to be **between
€262 million and €690 million** less (43% and 66%)

Grid infrastructure savings in low-voltage and medium-
voltage are between €77.6 billion and €203.6 billion (i.e.
between -27% and -80%) at EU 27 level between 2023 and

2030. The annual savings in 2030 are estimated to be
**between €11.1 billion and €29.1 billion.** These savings
are based on the hypothesis that grid-driven optimisation
is implemented, which may not always be the case in the
above-mentioned market-driven optimization cases. The
potential savings on transmission grids due to avoided
reinforcement and re-dispatch costs are not quantified.

This translates into direct and indirect consumer benefits.
The direct benefits are achieved by a direct saving due to
the shifting or curtailment of the load, whereas indirect
benefits are achieved due to the impact of DSF activation
in the entire system and its energy costs.

**Direct benefits** : The users of DSF technologies can save
between €0.01 and €0.16 per kWh. The results indicate

```
that the highest savings are achieved in space heating, with
a 64% cost reduction, followed by EV charging with a 48%
cost reduction (€0.07 per kWh saving). The lowest savings
are achieved by DSF technologies with higher variable
operation and maintenance costs, such as industrial DSR
and, to a lesser degree, batteries. These benefits are also
reflected in the indirect benefits; therefore, they should
not be double-counted.
```
```
Indirect benefits: The results indicate that the most
significant saving is due to the reduction of electricity
costs, reducing the costs to consumers by up to €673.5 per
person in the year 2030. This is due to the effect of DSF
in peak shaving and reduction of renewable curtailment,
which avoids the use of more expensive generation.
Following the electricity prices, and with a lower order
of magnitude, are infrastructure savings of between
€27.8 and €65 in cost reduction per capita in a year in
```
2030. The savings that would make the least impact are
those in balancing costs (€0.7 to €1.6 per capita in 2030);
these are relatively low because the size of the balancing
market is significantly smaller than wholesale trade. Finally,
one of the benefits for all consumers is the reduction of
carbon emissions. The DSF scenario would fulfil the 55%
reduction by 2030, while the no-DSF would not.

```
DNV calculated the savings that full DSF enablement (~160
GW in capacity across EU 27) by 2030 would achieve
against a scenario in which DSF is not available. The lack
of data on the utilised DSF today and DSF utilisation
prospects towards 2030 makes it impossible to quantify
the counterfactual system costs. Therefore, DNV modelled
a 2030 scenario in which DSF technologies are not flexible.
Realising that demand-side technologies are to some
extent – and in some Member States more than others
```
- already actively participating in the electricity market,
DNV acknowledges that **the reference scenario is not
a realistic scenario.** Therefore, all results, should be
interpreted as the **total potential benefit of DSF.** If, by
2030, certain barriers still exist to DSF fully participating
in the electricity market, a certain share of this potential

## KEY TAKE-AWAYS AND

# 6. RECOMMENDATIONS


will not be achieved. **The results provide an order-of-
magnitude value of this missed opportunity (albeit an
upper bound).**

The study presents several limitations, partly due to data
unavailability at European level. Moreover, the results
raised some questions that are worth analysing further.
Therefore, **DNV recommends to:**

Improve transparency on the current deployment of
DSF in wholesale and balancing markets throughout EU
27 by introducing market monitoring in a structured and
harmonised manner on DSF availability and deployment;

Assess and mitigate any regulatory, economic (e.g. grid
tariff methodology), and/or business (case) challenges
that may cause bottlenecks to further DSF deployment;

Develop a common methodology to quantify the
potential infrastructure savings resulting from a full
deployment of DSF per Member State;

Analyse which holistic market design (including grid
fee methodology and DSO flexibility services) can achieve
the optimal DSF deployment results for the combination
of both markets and infrastructure;

Investigate energy-efficiency potential resulting from
DSF deployment; and

Investigate the impact of more large-scale DSF
deployment on the investment climate for renewables
generators.

DEMAND-SIDE FLEXIBILITY IN THE EU: Quantification of benefits in 2030
```
**APPENDIX A –** Detailed

Methodology	Description

**1.1. Quantification of**

**wholesale and adequacy**

**benefits**

**1.1.1. QUANTIFICATION APPROACH**

DNV has used its European Market Model which is a
fundamental market model that simulates the day-
ahead spot price by optimising the unit commitment
and economic dispatch of electricity generation. The
simulations are performed on an hourly time-resolution
containing a detailed representation of generation,
commodity prices and demand for all bidding zones
in EU 27 Member States. The description of the model
inputs is described in section 2.

Among other parameters, the market model outputs the
hourly demand and generation mix, the hourly day-ahead
energy prices, and the total system emissions.

DNV has used the outputs of the model to quantify the
wholesale benefits. To do that, DNV has created two a
reference scenario to compare the 2030 results (“DSF
scenario”) – with full DSF potential – against. As explained
in section 2.4, DNV modelled a 2030 scenario in which
the demand side is not flexible to serve as a reference
scenario, albeit not realistic.

In the next section (1.1.2), there is a detailed explanation
on the approach taken to model the selected DSF
technologies in the DSF and no-DSF scenarios. The main
underlying assumptions to our modelling are:

DNV considers the full theoretical potential of DSF
of the selected technologies, although in practice some
consumers may not be interested to participate.

Some flexibility may not be available to the market, as it
is used for ‘in-building’ optimisation, e.g. to increase self-

```
consumption or to reduce grid fees. This is not explicitly
considered, because
```
- the grid benefits are determined separately (outside
the model), this model focuses on the market benefits.
- In practice, the behaviour triggered by in-building
optimisation, is very similar to the behaviour triggered
by market optimisation. For example, a home battery
will typically charge around noon on a summer day
whether there is local PV (in-building optimisation)
or not (market optimisation).

```
Time shifters (e.g. electric heating, EV charging and
batteries) do not have marginal costs, they are simply
optimised against wholesale prices within time constraints.
Battery and V2G need to take efficiency losses into account,
so there should be sufficient spread between charging
and discharging prices to cover these costs.
```
```
Wholesale
```
```
Using the output of the model, DNV calculates the
wholesale benefits by comparing the DSF and no-DSF
scenario:
```
```
Total carbon emissions in 2030: This is a direct output
of the model and it’s based on the carbon-based fuel
and biomass used by the dispatched generators. The
carbon capture and storage impact is also considered in
the results. The resulting emissions are then evaluated
against the targeted 2030 power system emissions to
fulfil the 55% emission reduction objective. This power
sector emission target is based on DNV’s energy transition
outlook model and it’s set at 410 eq. CO2 million tonnes.
```
```
Total curtailment volume in 2030: This is calculated by
subtracting the realised solar and wind generation to the
available generation in a given hour, for all the hours of the
year. The curtailment can be due to economic reasons or
```

interconnector capacity limitations. The model does not
consider curtailment due to distribution and transmission
constraints within the bidding zone.

Total generator costs: This is a direct output from
the model. These are the costs that generators/storage
incur to cover the system demand. These include fuel
costs, variable operation and maintenance (VOM) costs,
start and shutdown costs, emissions costs and penalties.
Penalties apply when a generator violates a constraint,
e.g. a minimum generation requirement.

Loss load (unserved load): This is calculated as the
sum of the hourly demand that is not met in 2030.

Cost to serve load: This is calculated for all loads in a
year and is defined as the price paid by the load times
the demand. The price paid by the load is the volume-
weighted price paid for all energy purchases in 2030.

**Adequacy**

To have a rough estimation of DSF adequacy benefits,
DNV also relies on the market model simulations results.
The approach is as follows:

**1. Calculate the demand power that was not served
by generation in the no-DSF scenario.
3. Calculate the CAPEX needed to enable the same
power, as in step 2, of industrial DSR.
2. Calculate the CAPEX needed to install a
generation plant that can cover the generation
power deficiency.
4. The rough estimate (lower bound) of DSF
benefit to generation adequacy is calculated as the
difference between step 3 and step 2 results.**

1.1.2. DEMAND AND DSF MODELLING
APPROACH AND INPUT PARAMETERS
```
```
In this section, the modelling of the different technologies
is explained in detail, for both the DSF and no-DSF
scenarios.
```
```
1.1.2.1. Industrial DSR
Industrial DSR is modelled as a generator whose generation
corresponds to an industrial load (partially) shutting down
its consumption. Industrial DSR is defined per country and
distinguished in five types of industrial load. Each type is
defined by the following parameters:
```
```
Installed capacity [MW]: max generation, i.e., max
curtailable load. It is defined as the total industrial DSR
capacity multiplied by a percentage that varies per type.
```
```
Variable O&M [€/MWh]: cost of shutting down the
industrial load
```
```
Max Up Time [h]: maximum number of consecutive
hours the industrial load can be curtailed
While the total industrial DSR capacity varies per country,
the distribution across load types, the variable O&M, and
the max up time are the same, as shown in Table 1.1.

The values for the abovementioned parameters are derived from several sources, which are listed in Table 1.2

- Industrial DSR data sources. Countries not listed in Table 1.2 are expected to have no industrial DSR installed
capacity in 2030.


The Variable O&M is derived from (ENTSO-E, 2021) by calculating the weighted average price across countries per
DSR type according to the max up time value.

No industrial DSR units are modelled in the no-DSF scenario.

**1.1.2.3. Smart charging**

EVs are modelled using the following parameters:

```
Max load [MW]: maximum hourly (charging) capacity.
Max Daily Consumption [GWh]: maximum daily load
Min Daily Consumption [GWh]: minimum daily load
```
EV charging load is optimised by the Market model.
However, it is subject to a daily load equality constraint that
cannot be violated, i.e., max energy day = min energy day.

### 1.1.2.2. BESS

Batteries are distinguished in behind-the-meter and grid-
connected BESS. Both types are defined by the following
parameters:

Units: number of units (following properties are defined
per unit).
Max Power [MW]: charging/discharging max power
capacity per unit.
Capacity [MWh]: capacity of each unit. A battery storage
duration of 3 hours is assumed, which is comparable to
Li-ion technology.
Min SoC [%]: minimum state of charge of a unit.
Initial SoC [%]: initial state of charge of a unit.
Charge/discharge efficiency [%].
Max Cycles Day: number of cycles allowed each day.

```
BESS charge and discharge depending on the power price
(see illustrative example in Figure 4), while satisfying
some constraints, namely, maximum charging/discharging
power, maximum storage capacity, minimum SoC, and
maximum cycles per day. For the battery to be activated,
the power price needs to show a sufficiently large spread
in one day look-ahead to overcome the cost of energy
due to efficiency losses.
```
```
The values of the abovementioned parameters are mostly
based on expert knowledge and are summarised in Table.
The number of units per BESS type per country are derived
from multiple sources, which are listed in Table 1.4.

Max load – maximum hourly (charging) capacity
```
```
The maximum hourly (charging) capacity is calculated
based on the maximum power capacity per country and
an availability profile. The maximum power capacity per
country is calculated based on the numbers of charging
points per country times the maximum power capacity
per car. The model assumes 10 kW/car.
```
```
The availability profile represents the share of charging
points occupied by a car per hour.
```

```

```
**Max daily consumption and Min daily consumption – maximum/minimum daily load**

The minimum and maximum daily load is calculated based on the annual EV consumption per country divided by 365.
The annual EV consumption per country is calculated based on the number of EVs times the annual consumption
per car, which is assumed equal to 2.5 MWh/year.

An overview of the input parameters is given in Table 1.5.

In the no-DSF scenario, EVs follow an hourly charging profile which they cannot deviate from.

The abovementioned parameters and availability profiles are derived from multiple sources which are listed in
Table 1.6.

### 1.1.2.4. V2G

It is assumed, based on expert knowledge, that 30% of the
EV charging infrastructure provides V2G possibility. V2G
is modelled as batteries with the following parameters:

```
Capacity [MWh]
Max power [MW]: power at full discharge
Max load [MW]: power at full charge
Initial SoC [%]
Charge/discharge efficiency [%]
Max Cycles Day: number of cycles allowed each day.
```
```
Capacity
```
```
It corresponds to the storage capacity available for V2G. It
is calculated based on the number of EVs per country times
the max energy capacity per car, and on the assumption
that 30% of the grid connected EVs provides V2G capacity.
Max power and max load – power at full discharge/charge
It corresponds to the power capacity available for V2G.
It is calculated based on the EV max load (see Section
1.1.2.3) and on the assumption that 30% of the EVs
provides V2G capacity.
```
An overview of the input parameter is given in Table 1.7. Data sources are the same used for smart charging (see
Table 1.6).


V2G is not modelled in the no-DSF scenario.

**1.1.2.5. Residential electric heating**
Residential electric heating represents residential and
commercial space heating electricity demand. It is
considered as a shiftable load, and it is modelled using
the following parameters:

Max Load [MW]: maximum hourly consumption.
Min Load 12 h [GWh]: maximum total space heating
consumption in 12-hour day/night period.
Max Load 12 [GWh]: minimum total space heating
consumption in 12-hour day/night period.

Residential electric heating load is optimised in the Market
model. However, it is subject to a 12-hour load equality
constraint that cannot be violated, i.e., min load 12 h
= max load 12 h. Therefore, it can provide flexibility by
shifting the consumptions while respecting the 12 hours
load requirement.

**Max load – maximum hourly consumption**

Max load corresponds to the maximum possible
consumption from residential space electric heating in
every hour, per country. The maximum load is the same
for every hour.

```
Min and Max load 12 h – maximum/minimum
consumption in 12-hour period
```
```
The minimum and maximum daily load is cal
culated based on the annual residential electric heating
consumption per country, distributed among the days
based on a daily space heating demand profile. This
daily consumption is divided in two periods of 12 hours
each, i.e. half of the total daily consumption is required
in each 12-hour period.
```
```
The 12-hour periods are defined as:
```
```
Day period: from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
Night period: from 9 p.m. to 9 a.m.
```
```
The minimum and maximum 12-hour load is defined
with the same value. Therefore, the consumption can
be shifted across a 12-hour timeframe, but the required
consumption (minimum and maximum) must be fulfilled
in those 12 hours.
```
```
In the no-DSF scenario, residential electric heating follows
an hourly consumption profile per country, from which
there cannot be deviations. Hence, demand cannot be
shifted across time.
```
```
The abovementioned consumption values and daily
profiles are derived from multiple sources which are
listed in Table 1.9.

**1.1.2.6. Industrial electric heating**
Industrial electric heating is considered as a curtailable
load, and it is modelled using the following parameters:

```
Max Load [MW]: maximum hourly consumption.
Bid Quantity [MW]: demand bid.
Bid Price [€/MWh]: price of the demand bid.
```
Industrial electric heating load can reduce part of its
consumption when prices reach a certain activation price.

**Max load – maximum hourly consumption**

Max load corresponds to the maximum possible
consumption from industrial electric heating in every
hour, per country. The maximum load is the same for
every hour.

**Bid quantity – demand bid**

Bid quantity represents the hourly consumption from
industrial electric heating, and is defined with the
same values as Max Load. Therefore, bid quantity is the
hourly consumption and also the maximum possible
load shedding.

**Bid price – price of the demand bid**

Bid prices represents the activation price for industrial
electric heating curtailment. The load will be curtailed
if the prices reach this specific bid price. The bid price is
defined as 500 €/MWh.

In the no-DSF scenario, industrial electric heating cannot
curtail the consumption.

The values of the abovementioned parameters are mostly
based on expert knowledge and DNVs internal data.

```
1.1.2.7. Industrial heating – CHP
Industrial heating from CHP units is represented by CHP
generators with hourly generation requirements. The
units can deviate from the generation requirements by
incurring certain penalty. These units are modelled as
standard generators, with several additional parameters:
```
```
Min Energy Hour [MWh]: minimum hourly generation.
Min Energy Penalty [€/MWh]: penalty for not reaching
the minimum hourly generation.
```
```
Min Energy Hour – minimum hourly generation.
```
```
The minimum generation per hour is defined depending
on the hour of the day:
```
```
Peak hours: from 5 a.m. to 8 p.m. the unit should
generate at 100% of its capacity.
```
```
Off-peak hours: from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. the unit should
generate at minimum 65% of its capacity.
```
```
Min Energy Penalty – penalty for not reaching the
minimum hourly generation
```
```
If the generation does not reach the required level defined
by Min Energy Hour, then a penalty is incurred. The value
of this penalty is defined as 1000 €/MWh.
```
```
In the no-DSF scenario, industrial heating CHPs cannot
deviate from the generation requirements described
above. Deviations by either not reaching or surpassing
the requirement are not allowed.
```
```
The values of the abovementioned parameters are mostly
based on DNVs internal data.
```

**1.1.2.8. District heating – CHP**
District heating residential CHP units are represented
by CHP generators with daily generation requirements
which are linked to the daily heat demand. CHP units are
defined as part of a heating area for which they must fulfil
certain level of generation per day, which represents the
required heat consumption. These units are modelled as
standard generators, with several additional parameters:

Min daily generation [GWh]: minimum daily generation.
Min daily generation penalty [€/GWh]: penalty for not
reaching the minimum daily generation.

**Min daily generation – minimum daily generation**

The minimum daily generation of each CHP unit is based
on the minimum annual generation requirement for that
heating area. This requirement is defined as the installed
capacity of each CHP belonging to that heating area,
multiplied by the average CHP full load hours. DNV has
considered 3000 full load hours.

The annual requirement is translated into a daily constraint,
by distributing the annual minimum generation among
the days of the year, based on a daily heating demand
profile per country.

**Min daily generation penalty – penalty for not reaching
the minimum daily generation**

The CHP units can deviate from the minimum daily
generation by incurring a penalty. This penalty represents
the replacement of the CHP generation by a gas boiler.
The value consider for this penalty is 41914.6 €/GWh.

In the no-DSF scenario, district heating CHP cannot
deviate from the generation requirements described
above. Deviations by either not reaching or surpassing
the requirement are not allowed.

The values of the abovementioned parameters are mostly
based on expert knowledge and DNVs internal data.

```
1.1.2.9. Electrolysers
Electrolyser consumption is considered as a curtailable
load, and it is modelled using the following parameters:
```
```
Max Load [MW]: maximum hourly consumption.
Max Yearly Consumption [GWh]
```
```
Max Load [MW]: maximum hourly consumption.
```
```
Bid Quantity [MW]: demand bid.
Bid Price [€/MWh]: price of the demand bid.
```
```
Electrolyser load can reduce part of its consumption
when prices reach a certain activation price. Moreover,
the annual consumption defined needs to be fulfilled.
However, the hours when this consumption occurs are
optimised by the Market model, based on the power
prices and system requirements.
```
```
Maximum yearly consumption
```
```
The maximum annual consumption is determined for every
country, and it is based on the REPowerEU Communication
that presents a target of 10 million tons of renewable
hydrogen production in Europe.
```
```
Max load – maximum hourly consumption
```
```
Max load corresponds to the maximum possible
consumption from electrolysers in every hour, per country.
The maximum load is the same for every hour. This value
is based on the EU27 estimated Max yearly consumption
and the electrolyser utilization factor. The electrolyser
capacity for each county is distributed based on the ratio
traditional load country/traditional load EU27.
```
```
Maximum yearly consumption
```
```
The maximum annual consumption is determined for every
country, and it is based on the REPowerEU Communication
that presents a target of 10 million tons of renewable
hydrogen production in Europe.
```
```
Bid quantity – demand bid
```
```
Bid quantity represents the hourly consumption from
electrolysers, and it is defined with the same values as Max
Load. Therefore, bid quantity is the hourly consumption
and also the maximum possible load shedding.
Bid price – price of the demand bid
```

```
DEMAND-SIDE FLEXIBILITY IN THE EU: Quantification of benefits in 2030
```
Bid prices represents the activation price for electrolyser load curtailment. The load will be curtailed if the prices reach
this specific bid price. The bid price is defined as 86.2 €/MWh, based on the cost of producing hydrogen. (RTE, 2016)

In the no-DSF scenario, electrolyser load is defined, additionally to the parameters mentioned above, with a Min
Energy Year requirement. This parameter is defined with the same data as the maximum energy year property.
Hence, the annual electrolyser load is fixed and cannot be curtailed, but load shifting can still occur.

The abovementioned annual targets are derived from the following sources:

```
**1.1.3. LIMITATIONS OF THE APPROACH**

DNV acknowledges that the proposed approach for the
quantification of market and adequacy benefits shows
some limitations which are briefly presented below:

No-DSF scenario and modelled flexible technologies:
The no-DSF scenario does not provide a realistic
counterfactual, but rather a reference scenario that
estimates the full available potential. At the same time,
due to data unavailability, DNV did not include a few
relevant DSF technologies in their modelling. Therefore,
the savings are the upper bound of savings considering
the modelled, but not for ALL potential DSF capacity.

Industrial DSR marginal costs: Despite more detailed
insight for the Netherlands in terms of industrial process
and cost details, DNV decided to exclude this from the
model and instead work with the assumptions provided
the above sources, that are less process-specific.
Predominantly because a detailed country-by-country
analysis regarding (details of) industrial processes goes
beyond the scope of this research. The used figures are
therefore assumed to be more conservative. For example:
In the Netherlands, our previous studies indicated that
there is relatively cheap DSR capacity from chlorine
production. Dutch chlorine production is only a few %
of what’s produced in Europe, but we DNV did not find
any evidence of chlorine production in other countries
being used to provide DSR (at an equally low cost).

```
Potential flexibility from public charging points not
included, based on the assumption that most cars
connected to public chargers will not be able to provide
a lot of flexibility as drivers will want to ‘move on’.
```
```
Apart from EVs, other means of electric transport such
as electric buses or trucks are not modelled. This is due
to data unavailability.
```
```
Investment costs are not considered for either scenario.
```
```
The category Residential electric heating represents
space heating demand and includes the electricity demand
of heat pump technologies for residential and commercial
buildings. Other technologies are not included in this
category.
```
```
DNV has taken a conservative approach and considered
residential electric heating as a shiftable load. An RTE
report (RTE, 2016) suggests that up to 50% of residential
electric heating can be saved when DSF is activated,
i.e. residential electric heating is not only shiftable
but curtailable. The model has not incorporated the
quantification insights of this report since it is based
on a different technology (Joule effect heating), limited
period of the year and limited geography. However, DNV
acknowledges that residential heating flexibility could
provide additional savings, next to the savings that are
provided by load shifting according to the results.
```

Due to the high electrolyser installed capacity, the electrolyser bidding price has a high impact on system prices.
Although the bidding price highly depends on the characteristics from individual electrolyser plants, the model
assumes a constant bidding price throughout Europe.

The flexibility that could be provided by cooling technologies has not been considered in this analysis. This was
due to limited data availability at European level.

The renewable curtailment presented in this report refers to the curtailment due to higher available generation
than load and considers the possible congestion of the interconnectors. However, congestion in national distribution
and transmission networks is not considered.

**1.2. Quantification of system balancing benefits**

**1.2.1. QUANTIFICATION APPROACH**

DNV calculated the DSF balancing energy benefits based on the different marginal costs for eligible balancing
technologies at EU level. To do so, this approach was followed:

**Step 1** consisted of data collection, DNV collected information on reserve volumes, reserve capacities and marginal
costs. The calculated total activated balancing reserves for EU 27 in 2021 (these are assumed to be the same in 2030).
The total activated reserves are extracted from ENTSO-E (ENTSO-E, 2022) and are summarised in the table below:


```

```
DEMAND-SIDE FLEXIBILITY IN THE EU: Quantification of benefits in 2030
```
**Step 2** consisted of building the technology merit order for the provision of balancing energy in 2030 per scenario
(DSF and no-DSF scenario).

The DSF scenario included all technologies that are considered as DSF in the modelling exercise (e.g. smart charging,
batteries behind the meter, electric heating, industrial DSR, etc) as well as other flexible technologies (electrolysers
and front of the meter BESS) and traditional balancing reserve providers (gas turbines, gas power plants, hydro
power, etc.)

The capacities used to build the merit order were derived from the calculated DSF power in the previous section,
as well as the input generation capacities in DNV’s power market model for 2030.

An example of merit order is presented in Figure 12. The figure includes the technology merit order for providing
upward aFRR energy for each scenario. The green band represents the required aFRR capacity for all EU. Figure
13 zooms in the merit order to show more details in the relevant capacity range. It can be observed that all aFRR
upward capacity can be provided by hydro energy in the no-DSF scenario (at around 6 €/MWh) and by residential
DSF in the DSF scenario (at around 3 €/MWh).

DEMAND-SIDE FLEXIBILITY IN THE EU: Quantification of benefits in 2030
```
**1.2.2. LIMITATIONS OF THE APPROACH**

DNV acknowledges that the proposed approach for the quantification of system balancing benefits shows some
limitations which are briefly presented below:

The balancing requirements at European level are calculated as a sum of country-specific balancing-capacity
requirements. DNV does not quantify the synergies of having a unified European market and how that affects the
balancing requirements.

The quantification assumes that there is enough interconnection capacity available between bidding zones, so
all flexibility is available to all systems.

The merit order is built based on marginal costs of the different technologies only. Other costs such as opportunity
costs (e.g. the missed revenue for not selling their flexibility in other markets such as congestion management) are
not included.

Based on the merit order and the required capacities, the cut out marginal costs for balancing energy is determined.
For some products there is a range of marginal costs because the reserve required capacity band intersects with
more than one technology. The results are presented in the table below:

Finally, **step 3** consisted of calculating the balancing costs for all reserve services based on the merit orders in **step**

**2.** The DSF benefits were calculated as the difference between the no-DSF scenario balancing costs and the DSF
scenario balancing costs. The results are summarised below:

**1.3.1. DESKTOP RESEARCH**

DNV has conducted desktop research on the infrastructural benefits that DSF may enable. The research looked for
studies that have quantified the benefits related to delayed or deferred grid reinforcements by 2030, preferably
published in the last 5 years and focusing in one or multiple countries for the EU 27+ area. Table 1.1 provides a
selection of the studies reviewed by DNV for this desktop research.

DEMAND-SIDE FLEXIBILITY IN THE EU: Quantification of benefits in 2030
```
The desktop research has shown that very little literature is currently available on the quantification of infrastructural
benefits in terms of delayed or deferred grid investments that DSF may enable. On the one hand, the interpretation
of the concept of flexibility in many studies is not consistent with the one used for this evaluation. Flexibility is
also often sought on the generation side of the system rather than on the demand side, for instance by means
of CCGT gas turbines. When focusing on DSF, many studies primarily quantify of the flexibility potential of one or
multiple technologies without investigating the potential infrastructural benefits. Others provide a very high-level
definition of DSF, for instance 20% of the peak demand that can be shifted throughout the day. On the other hand,
the results of those studies that quantify the benefits may not be applicable to the task at hand. For example, some
studies quantify the benefits of additional flexible technology capacity rather than the benefits of the use of flexible
technologies. Other results are too case-specific or grid-specific to be scaled at EU level.

Overall, DNV acknowledges the scarcity of studies on the infrastructural benefits of DSF. It was, therefore, impossible
to pursue the original plan of estimating the infrastructural benefits in a Fit for 55 scenario based on existing studies
based on either country-specific or EU 27 grid simulations.

DNV has, therefore, defined a two-phase approach to estimate the infrastructural benefits at EU level relying on the
limited number of relevant studies. Next, the approach is detailed, and its main limitations are discussed.

**1.3.2. QUANTIFICATION APPROACH**

DNV approach for the quantification of infrastructural benefits focuses on distribution grid investments and it is
structured in two phases: a top-down phase to estimate the required investments per country and a bottom-up
phase to estimate the potential savings at EU 27 level. The approach strongly relies on the figures presented in the
(Eurelectric, 2021) study on the required distribution grid investments in EU 27+ to enable the energy transition and
in the (E-Bridge, 2019) study on the benefits of the grid-friendly use of flexibility in German distribution networks.
The study (Eurelectric, 2021) assesses DSO investments requires for enabling the energy transition in Europe and
develops policies and recommendations. The study estimates 375 – 425 billion € of power distribution grid require
investments between 2020 and 2030 in EU 27+UK. These figures are extrapolated based on information provided
by the DSOs of 10 countries accounting for about 70% of EU electricity demand. The required investments are
divided into four main areas, the largest being due to electrification and renewables, and eight main investment
drivers. DNV refers to this study to estimate the required investments in distribution grids by 2030 in a Fit for 55
scenario based on three main drivers, namely final electricity demand, electric vehicles, and RES capacity connected
to distribution grid.

The study (E-Bridge, 2019) quantifies the economic potential of flexibility for congestion management in the German
distribution grid for the year 2035 and determines the possible benefits in terms of deferral of grid expansion
investments through a better utilisation of the grid. The study relies on thousands of grid simulations and shows
that, while the increase in flexibility used purely for the benefit of the market/system leads to an increasing need
for grid expansion, a grid-friendly use of flexibility may reduce the required investments in German distribution
grid by 55%. DNV refers to this study to estimate the potential savings in grid investments at EU 27 level thanks to
a grid-friendly use of demand side flexibility.


The first phase of the DNV approach is top-down and
estimates the required investments in distribution
grid between 2023 and 2030. It uses the figures from
**(Eurelectric, 2021)** on the investments in distribution grids
due to electrification and renewables and its breakdown
per relevant investment drivers, namely, electrification
of buildings and industry, electrification of mobility, and
emission-free generation.

The bottom-up phase estimates the infrastructural benefits
in 2030 in a Fit for 55 scenario thanks to DSF. It uses the
figures from (E-Bridge, 2019) on the potential savings in
investments when DSF is operated in a grid-friendly way
rather than in a market/system friendly way. Based on
the market simulation results, the savings presented by
(E-Bridge, 2019) for German distribution networks are
scaled and applied to the other countries. Finally, the
total EU 27 savings are calculated.

```
1.3.2.1. Top-down phase
The top-down phase consists in the following steps:
```
```
1 Estimate of the investment per unit of driver based
on (Eurelectric, 2021). The study (Eurelectric, 2021)
estimates that the electrification of the energy demand
and the increase in renewable capacity will require 180–
210 billion € investments in distribution grids between
2020 and 2030. The main drivers are the following:
increase in final electricity demand, electric vehicles, and
emission-free generation. The study expects an increase
in total power demand between 2017 and 2030 of 732
TWh, which is responsible for 70–80 billion € investment.
Additionally, the number of EVs in 2030 is expected to
reach 50–70 million vehicles and is responsible for 25–35
billion €. Furthermore, the renewable capacity connected
to distribution grids is estimated to increase by 360 GW
between 2017 and 2030, requiring 85–95 billion €. The
impact of each driver on the total required investments
is summarised in Table 1.12.

The approach proposed by DNV is shown in Figure 15.

```
**2** _Estimate of required investments in distribution grids in EU 27 between 2023 and 2030 in Fit for 55 scenario._ Using
the DNV’s European Power Market Model for 2023 and the 2030 model developed for this study, DNV estimates the
values of investments associated with the main investment driver identified at the previous step. The share of solar
PV and wind capacity connected to the distribution grid is calculated using the figures provided for ten countries
by (Eurelectric, 2021). For those countries for which the study does not report a figure, the share of countries with
comparable area is used. Table 1.13 summarizes the results. The total required investments in distribution grids in
EU 27 between 2023 and 2030 are between 253.1 and 282.5 billion €.

**3** _Estimate required investments in distribution grids per country between 2023 and 2030._ The estimated investments
at EU 27 level are distributed across countries using three metrics that quantify the extent to which each country
contributes to the investment drivers at European level previously identified. Namely, the metrics represent the share
of increase in total demand, the share in EVs, and the share of additional RES capacity. The range of investments
253.1 – 282.5 billion € is, hence, distributed cross countries using these metrics. As a result, six values are obtained
per country and a range of investment is defined. See box below for an illustrative example.

```
```
Country X range of investments: 4.7 – 11.4 billion
```

**1.3.2.2. Bottom-up phase**
The bottom-up phase consists of the following steps:

**4** _Calculate relation between available flexible capacity and savings._ The study (E-Bridge, 2019) estimates the
flexible capacity coming from electric heat applications at 6.5 GW, from EVs at 10.5 GW, and from small storage
at 5.5 GW. Additionally, it estimates that residential, industrial, and trade and commerce traditional load can
provide 12%, 4.8%, and 21% of flexibility, respectively. Since the study reports no figure of the peak load and it was
conducted in 2019, the German 2035 estimate for peak load according to the 2019 update of the DNV’s European
Power Market Model is used as a reference, i.e., 133 GW of peak demand in 2035. Averaging the flexibility ratios
of traditional load reported by the study, it can be assumed that 12.6% of the peak demand is flexible. In total, the
calculated available flexible capacity by 2035 is 39.3 GW, which results from adding up flexibility of EVs, storage,
e-heating and flexible traditional load.

Therefore, it is calculated that a flexible capacity to peak demand of 29.5% leads to 76.9% savings.^18

```
5 Estimate savings in % per country. The potential percentage savings are calculated per country based on:
```
Available flexible capacity;^19
the relation derived at step 4, i.e., a flexibility capacity to peak load ratio of 29.5% leads to 76.9% savings;
and
peak demand in 2030.

The savings in % are calculated per country as follow:

See box below for an illustrative example.

18. This percentage of savings only accounts for savings on low voltage and medium voltage distribution grids
19. DSF flexible power is derived from the results of section 2 – quantification of DSF in 2030. The grid benefits quantification approach is based on the upward flexible power.

```
savings%= availableFlexCapacity 76.9%
peak load 29.5%
```
```
Country X – market simulation output:
```
```
Available flexible capacity: 2 GW
Peak load: 9.9 GW
```
```
Step 5:
Country X savings in %: 52.6% (2/9.9 * 76.9%/29.5%)
```

```
DEMAND-SIDE FLEXIBILITY IN THE EU: Quantification of benefits in 2030
```
**6** _Estimate savings at EU 27 level._ Based on the estimated savings in % per country according to step 5, the
potential range of savings in each country is calculated. Finally, the potential infrastructural savings in distribution
grid investments at EU 27 level between 2023 and 2030 thanks to grid-friendly DSF are calculated by summing up
the country-specific values.

The savings at EU 27 level between 2023 and 2030 are estimated at 77.6–203.6 billion €, which corresponds to
annual savings of 11.1 and 29.1 billion €.

**1.3.3. LIMITATIONS OF THE APPROACH**
DNV acknowledges that the proposed approach for the quantification of infrastructural benefits shows some
limitations, which are briefly presented below:

The relation between DSF power and investment savings
is neither derived from literature nor from grid model
simulation results, but rather calculated based on data
derived from two different sources, namely, (E-Bridge,
2019) and DNV’s European Power Market Model 2019
update.

The quantified investments and savings refer to the
distribution grid only. Investments required in transmission
grids are not quantified.

The quantified investments account for integration
of new (electrified) loads and RES capacity only. Other
investments, such as digitalisation and smart meter roll
out, are not calculated.

```
The approach does not take into account the differences
in the current status of development across distribution
grids. For example, those countries still mostly relying
on gas-based heating systems might face larger costs to
enable distribution grids to cope with increasing heat
pump capacity and electric heating load than those
countries already largely relying on electric heating
systems.
```
```
The approach does not take into account the differences
across countries regarding voltage level in the distribution
grid. The approach assumes that the savings are on low
voltage and medium voltage distribution grid.
```
```
The investment costs per driver are assumed to be
linear while they may strongly depend on other factors,
such us the current status of the distribution grids.
