Approximate heat demand for all weather years.

:func:`approximate_heat_demand` approximates annual heat demand based on energy totals and heating degree days (HDD) using a regression of heat demand on HDDs.

Inputs
------
- `resources/<run_name>/energy_totals.csv`: Energy consumption by sector (columns), country and year. Output of :func:`scripts.build_energy_totals.py`.
- `data/era5-annual-HDD-per-country.csv`: Number of heating degree days by year (columns) and country (index).

Outputs
-------
- `resources/<run_name>/heat_totals.csv`: Approximated annual heat demand for each country.

    """
    Approximate heat demand for a set of countries based on energy totals and
    heating degree days (HDD). A polynomial regression of heat demand on HDDs
    is performed on the data from 2007 to 2021. Then, for 2022 and 2023, the
    heat demand is estimated from known HDDs based on the regression.

    Parameters
    ----------
    energy_totals : pd.DataFrame
        DataFrame with energy consumption by sector (columns), country and year. Output of :func:`scripts.build_energy_totals.py`.
    hdd : pd.DataFrame
        DataFrame with number of heating degree days by year (columns) and country (index).

    Returns
    -------
    pd.DataFrame
        DataFrame with approximated heat demand for each country.

    Notes
    -----
    - Missing data is filled forward for GB in 2020 and backward for CH from 2007 to 2009.
    - If only one year of heating data is available for a country, a point (0, 0) is added to make the polynomial fit work.
