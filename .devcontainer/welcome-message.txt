👋 Welcome to Kubernetes contribution in a dev container! 
     Works in GitHub Codespaces, VS Code, or in docker using the devcontainer cli

See https://www.kubernetes.dev/docs/onboarding/ for guidance on contributing to Kuberentes

This debian dev container image satisfies https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/development.md and includes:
 - kubernetes/kubernetes repository
 - Docker
 - go
 - kubectl, etcd, kubetest2, and kind 
For details about dev containers and the debian dev container base image see https://containers.dev and https://github.com/devcontainers/images/tree/main/src/base-debian.
The configuration for the dev container is in the .github/.devcontainer folder. (will be moved to prow)
🎵 By default in Codespaces this environment uses a 4-core machine. Some tests may require a larger machine. In Codespaces you can change the machine type. 
   See https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/customizing-your-codespace/changing-the-machine-type-for-your-codespace

⚙️ If you are working in Codespaces on your own fork, this environment is automatically configured to support the GitHub 
   workflow https://www.kubernetes.dev/docs/guide/github-workflow/ (omit the clone step)
↪️ Otherwise Codespaces will automatically fork the repository for you when you make your first push
