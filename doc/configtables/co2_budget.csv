,Unit,Values,Description
co2_budget,--,"Dictionary with keys ``emissions_scope``, ``values``, ``upper``, and ``lower``","Unified configuration for CO2 budget constraints that works consistently across all foresight modes (overnight, myopic, perfect). The ``emissions_scope`` specifies which greenhouse gas(es) to account for from EEA UNFCCC data. Valid options: ``All greenhouse gases - (CO2 equivalent)`` (all GHGs in CO₂-equivalent, **default**), ``CO2`` (carbon dioxide only), ``CH4`` (methane), or ``N2O`` (nitrous oxide). The default aligns with EU climate policy targets."
co2_budget.values,--,"String (``absolute`` or ``fraction``)","Interpretation mode for all per-period budget values (applies to both upper and lower bounds): ``absolute`` (Gt CO₂/year, default) or ``fraction`` (percentage of 1990 baseline, scope-dependent). For example, with ``values: fraction``: ``2030: 0.450`` = 45% of 1990 emissions; with ``values: absolute``: ``2030: 2.04`` = 2.04 Gt CO₂/year."
co2_budget.upper,--,"Null, number, or dictionary","Upper emissions constraint. ``null`` disables the upper bound. A scalar number applies a single timeless CO₂ constraint (overnight/myopic: one per composed horizon; perfect: one joint constraint across all horizons, scaled by total modelled years). A dictionary maps year to value and **only specified years are constrained** (omitted years have no upper bound); a year can be set to ``null`` to explicitly disable an inherited default. Values are interpreted according to ``co2_budget.values``."
co2_budget.lower,--,"Null, number, or dictionary","Lower emissions constraint (optional). ``null`` disables the lower bound. A scalar number applies a single timeless CO₂ floor (same semantics as ``upper``). A dictionary maps year to value and **only specified years are constrained**; a year can be set to ``null`` to explicitly disable an inherited default. Values are interpreted according to ``co2_budget.values``. Note: a lower bound is only applied when an upper bound exists for the same horizon."
co2_budget.emissions_scope,--,String,"Specifies which greenhouse gas(es) to account for from EEA UNFCCC data. Options: ``All greenhouse gases - (CO2 equivalent)`` (default), ``CO2``, ``CH4``, ``N2O``. Used to determine the 1990 baseline for ``values: fraction``."
