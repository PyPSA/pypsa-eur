,Unit,Values,Description
co2_budget,--,"Dictionary with keys ``emissions_scope``, ``values``, ``upper``, and ``lower``","Unified configuration for CO2 budget constraints that works consistently across all foresight modes (overnight, myopic, perfect). The ``emissions_scope`` specifies which greenhouse gas(es) to account for from EEA UNFCCC data. Valid options: ``All greenhouse gases - (CO2 equivalent)`` (all GHGs in CO₂-equivalent, **default**), ``CO2`` (carbon dioxide only), ``CH4`` (methane), or ``N2O`` (nitrous oxide). The default aligns with EU climate policy targets."
co2_budget.values,--,"String (``absolute`` or ``fraction``)","Interpretation mode for all per-period budget values (applies to both upper and lower bounds): ``absolute`` (Gt CO₂/year, default) or ``fraction`` (percentage of 1990 baseline, scope-dependent). For example, with ``values: fraction``: ``2030: 0.450`` = 45% of 1990 emissions; with ``values: absolute``: ``2030: 2.04`` = 2.04 Gt CO₂/year."
co2_budget.upper,--,"Dictionary with keys ``enable``, optional year keys, ``total``, and ``distribution``","Upper emissions constraints. Set ``enable: true`` to activate. Per-period caps can be specified as year keys, interpreted according to ``co2_budget.values``. **Only specified years are constrained**; omitted years have no upper bound. The ``total`` field specifies a cumulative budget in Gt CO₂ (for perfect foresight: cumulative over all periods; for myopic/overnight: requires ``distribution``). The ``distribution`` field specifies how to split the total budget: ``ex0`` (exponential decay, r=0), ``ex1`` (exponential, r=1), ``be1`` (beta decay, parameter=1), ``be2`` (beta, parameter=2), ``linear``, or ``equal``. When both a per-period cap and distributed budget exist for the same horizon, the minimum (more restrictive) value is used."
co2_budget.lower,--,"Dictionary with keys ``enable`` and optional year keys","Lower emissions constraints (optional). Set ``enable: true`` to activate. Per-period floors can be specified as year keys, interpreted according to ``co2_budget.values`` (e.g., with ``values: absolute``: ``2030: 0.5`` = 0.5 Gt CO₂/year; with ``values: fraction``: ``2030: 0.2`` = 20% of 1990). **Only specified years are constrained**; omitted years have no lower bound. Prevents unrealistic/too-fast decarbonization in early years. Primarily used for perfect foresight optimization."
co2_budget.emissions_scope,--,String,"Specifies which greenhouse gas(es) to account for from EEA UNFCCC data. Options: ``All greenhouse gases - (CO2 equivalent)`` (default), ``CO2``, ``CH4``, ``N2O``. **Always affects the model** by determining baseline emissions used in co2_totals.csv (for fraction-based budgets) and budget distribution calculations (for total+distribution mode). Moved from master's ``energy.emissions`` config location to consolidate CO2 budget settings."
