,Unit,Values,Description
year,--,YYYY; e.g. '2030',Year for which to retrieve cost assumptions of ``resources/costs.csv``.
version,--,vX.X.X or <user>/<repo>/vX.X.X; e.g. 'v0.5.0',Version of ``technology-data`` repository to use. If this string is of the form <user>/<repo>/<version> then costs are instead retrieved from ``github.com/<user>/<repo>`` at the <version> tag.
rooftop_share,--,float,Share of rooftop PV when calculating capital cost of solar (joint rooftop and utility-scale PV).
social_discountrate,p.u.,float,Social discount rate to compare costs in different investment periods. 0.02 corresponds to a social discount rate of 2%.
fill_values,--,float,Default values if not specified for a technology in ``resources/costs.csv``.
capital_cost,EUR/MW,Keys should be in the 'technology' column of ``resources/costs.csv``. Values can be any float.,"For the given technologies, assumptions about their capital investment costs are set to the corresponding value. Optional; overwrites cost assumptions from ``resources/costs.csv``."
marginal_cost,EUR/MWh,Keys should be in the 'technology' column of ``resources/costs.csv``. Values can be any float.,"For the given technologies, assumptions about their marginal operating costs are set to the corresponding value. Optional; overwrites cost assumptions from ``resources/costs.csv``."
emission_prices,,,Specify exogenous prices for emission types listed in ``network.carriers`` to marginal costs.
-- enable,bool,true or false,Add cost for a carbon-dioxide price configured in ``costs: emission_prices: co2`` to ``marginal_cost`` of generators (other emission types listed in ``network.carriers`` possible as well)
-- co2,EUR/t,float,Exogenous price of carbon-dioxide added to the marginal costs of fossil-fuelled generators according to their carbon intensity. Added through the keyword ``Ep`` in the ``{opts}`` wildcard only in the rule :mod:`prepare_network``.
-- co2_monthly_price,bool,true or false,Add monthly cost for a carbon-dioxide price based on historical values built by the rule ``build_monthly_prices``
