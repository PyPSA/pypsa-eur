,Unit,Values,Description
default_cutout,--,str|list,"Defines a default cutout. Can refer to a single cutout or a list of cutouts."
nprocesses,--,int,"Number of parallel processes in cutout preparation"
show_progress,bool,true/false,"Whether progressbar for atlite conversion processes should be shown. False saves time."
cutouts,,,
-- {name},--,"Convention is to name cutouts like ``<region>-<year>-<source>`` (e.g. ``europe-2013-sarah3-era5``).","Name of the cutout netcdf file. The user may specify multiple cutouts under configuration ``atlite: cutouts:``. Reference is used in configuration ``renewable: {technology}: cutout:``. The cutout ``base`` may be used to automatically calculate temporal and spatial bounds of the network."
-- -- module,--,"Subset of {'era5','sarah'}","Source of the reanalysis weather dataset (e.g. `ERA5 <https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5>`_ or `SARAH-3 <https://wui.cmsaf.eu/safira/action/viewDoiDetails?acronym=SARAH_V002>`_)"
-- -- x,°,"Float interval within [-180, 180]","Range of longitudes to download weather data for. If not defined, it defaults to the spatial bounds of all bus shapes."
-- -- y,°,"Float interval within [-90, 90]","Range of latitudes to download weather data for. If not defined, it defaults to the spatial bounds of all bus shapes."
-- -- dx,°,"Larger than 0.25","Grid resolution for longitude"
-- -- dy,°,"Larger than 0.25","Grid resolution for latitude"
-- -- time,,"Time interval within ['1979', '2018'] (with valid pandas date time strings)","Time span to download weather data for. If not defined, it defaults to the time interval spanned by the snapshots."
-- -- prepare_kwargs,,,"Dictionary of keyword arguments passed to ``atlite.Cutout.prepare()`` when building the cutout."
-- -- -- features,,"String or list of strings with valid cutout features ('influx', 'wind').","When freshly building a cutout, retrieve data only for those features. If not defined, it defaults to all available features."
-- -- -- sarah_dir,,str,"Path to the location where SARAH-2 or SARAH-3 data is stored; SARAH data requires a manual separate download, see the https://atlite.readthedocs.io for details. Required for building cutouts with SARAH, not required for ERA5 cutouts."
-- -- -- monthly_requests,,bool,"Whether to use monthly requests for ERA5 data when building the cutout. Helpful to avoid running into request limits with large cutouts. Defaults to False."
-- -- -- tmpdir,,str,"Path to a temporary directory where intermediate files are stored when building the cutout. Helpful when building large cutouts. Defaults to None."
