nprocesses,--,int,"Number of parallel processes in cutout preparation"
cutouts,,,
-- {name},--,"Convention is to name cutouts like ``<region>-<year>-<source>`` (e.g. ``europe-2013-era5``).","Name of the cutout netcdf file. The user may specify multiple cutouts under configuration ``atlite: cutouts:``. Reference is used in configuration ``renewable: {technology}: cutout:``. The cutout ``base`` may be used to automatically calculate temporal and spatial bounds of the network."
-- -- module,--,"Subset of {'era5','sarah'}","Source of the reanalysis weather dataset (e.g. `ERA5 <https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5>`_ or `SARAH-2 <https://wui.cmsaf.eu/safira/action/viewDoiDetails?acronym=SARAH_V002>`_)"
-- -- x,°,"Float interval within [-180, 180]","Range of longitudes to download weather data for. If not defined, it defaults to the spatial bounds of all bus shapes."
-- -- y,°,"Float interval within [-90, 90]","Range of latitudes to download weather data for. If not defined, it defaults to the spatial bounds of all bus shapes."
-- -- time,,"Time interval within ['1979', '2018'] (with valid pandas date time strings)","Time span to download weather data for. If not defined, it defaults to the time interval spanned by the snapshots."
-- -- features,,"String or list of strings with valid cutout features ('inlfux', 'wind').","When freshly building a cutout, retrieve data only for those features. If not defined, it defaults to all available features."
