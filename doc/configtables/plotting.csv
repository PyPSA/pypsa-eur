,Unit,Values,Description
map,,,
-- boundaries,Â°,"[x1,x2,y1,y2]",Boundaries of the map plots in degrees latitude (y) and longitude (x)
projection,,,
-- name,--,Valid Cartopy projection name,See https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/reference/projections.html for list of available projections.
-- args,--,--,"Other entries under 'projection' are passed as keyword arguments to the projection constructor, e.g. ``central_longitude: 10.``."
costs_max,bn Euro,float,Upper y-axis limit in cost bar plots.
costs_threshold,bn Euro,float,Threshold below which technologies will not be shown in cost bar plots.
energy_max,TWh,float,Upper y-axis limit in energy bar plots.
energy_min,TWh,float,Lower y-axis limit in energy bar plots.
energy_threshold,TWh,float,Threshold below which technologies will not be shown in energy bar plots.
countries,--,[str],List of countries you want to create the statistcs for. Statistics includes csv files and figures. Default is all coutries but also single countries can be defined like ``DE``.
carriers,--,[str],"Carrier you want to create the statistcs for, i.e. csv files and figures. This carrier must be an available bus carrier in your network or substring of a carrier or a defined carrier group."
carrier_groups,--,str -> carrier,Mapping from ``carrier_groups`` to individual bus carriers in the network.
metrics,--,[str],"List of metrics you want to create your statistics for. Default is `energy_balance' and 'total_cost'. However, you can choose other metrics from the list below:",
comparison_folder, --,str,"Folder name where the scenario comparison statistics are stored. If this is empty, no senario comparison plots will be generated Defaultis an empty string ''."
scenario_comparison,--,[str],"List of scenarios you want to compare. If the list is empty, all scenarios from ``run:name`` are compared. Only works, when a ``comparison_folder`` is defined. Default is an empty list."
nice_names,--,str -> str,Mapping from network ``carrier`` to a more readable name.
tech_colors,--,carrier -> HEX colour code,Mapping from network ``carrier`` to a colour (`HEX colour code <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Hex_triplet>`_).
