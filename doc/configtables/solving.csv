,Unit,Values,Description
options,,,
-- load_shedding,bool/float,"{'true','false', float}","Add generators with very high marginal cost to simulate load shedding and avoid problem infeasibilities. If load shedding is a float, it denotes the marginal cost in EUR/kWh."
-- transmission_losses,int,"[0-9]","Add piecewise linear approximation of transmission losses based on n tangents. Defaults to 0, which means losses are ignored."
-- noisy_costs,bool,"{'true','false'}","Add random noise to marginal cost of generators by :math:`\mathcal{U}(0.009,0,011)` and capital cost of lines and links by :math:`\mathcal{U}(0.09,0,11)`."
-- min_iterations,--,int,"Minimum number of solving iterations in between which resistance and reactence (``x/r``) are updated for branches according to ``s_nom_opt`` of the previous run."
-- max_iterations,--,int,"Maximum number of solving iterations in between which resistance and reactence (``x/r``) are updated for branches according to ``s_nom_opt`` of the previous run."
-- nhours,--,int,"Specifies the :math:`n` first snapshots to take into account. Must be less than the total number of snapshots. Rather recommended only for debugging."
-- clip_p_max_pu,p.u.,float,"To avoid too small values in the renewables` per-unit availability time series values below this threshold are set to zero."
-- skip_iterations,bool,"{'true','false'}","Skip iterating, do not update impedances of branches. Defaults to true."
-- track_iterations,bool,"{'true','false'}","Flag whether to store the intermediate branch capacities and objective function values are recorded for each iteration in ``network.lines['s_nom_opt_X']`` (where ``X`` labels the iteration)"
-- seed,--,int,"Random seed for increased deterministic behaviour."
solver,,,
-- name,--,"One of {'gurobi', 'cplex', 'cbc', 'glpk', 'ipopt'}; potentially more possible","Solver to use for optimisation problems in the workflow; e.g. clustering and linear optimal power flow."
-- options,--,"Key listed under ``solver_options``.","Link to specific parameter settings."
solver_options,,"dict","Dictionaries with solver-specific parameter settings."
mem,MB,"int","Estimated maximum memory requirement for solving networks."
