,Unit,Values,Description
simplify_network,,,
-- to_substations,bool,"{'true','false'}","Aggregates all nodes without power injection (positive or negative, i.e. demand or generation) to electrically closest ones"
-- algorithm,str,"One of {‘kmeans’, ‘hac’, ‘modularity‘}",
-- feature,str,"Str in the format ‘carrier1+carrier2+...+carrierN-X’, where CarrierI can be from {‘solar’, ‘onwind’, ‘offwind’, ‘ror’} and X is one of {‘cap’, ‘time’}.",
-- exclude_carriers,list,"List of Str like [ 'solar', 'onwind'] or empy list []","List of carriers which will not be aggregated. If empty, all carriers will be aggregated."
cluster_network,,,
-- algorithm,str,"One of {‘kmeans’, ‘hac’}",
-- feature,str,"Str in the format ‘carrier1+carrier2+...+carrierN-X’, where CarrierI can be from {‘solar’, ‘onwind’, ‘offwind’, ‘ror’} and X is one of {‘cap’, ‘time’}.",
-- exclude_carriers,list,"List of Str like [ 'solar', 'onwind'] or empy list []","List of carriers which will not be aggregated. If empty, all carriers will be aggregated."
aggregation_strategies,,,
-- generators,,,
-- -- {key},str,"{key} can be any of the component of the generator (str). It’s value can be any that can be converted to pandas.Series using getattr(). For example one of {min, max, sum}.","Aggregates the component according to the given strategy. For example, if sum, then all values within each cluster are summed to represent the new generator."
-- buses,,,
-- -- {key},str,"{key} can be any of the component of the bus (str). It’s value can be any that can be converted to pandas.Series using getattr(). For example one of {min, max, sum}.","Aggregates the component according to the given strategy. For example, if sum, then all values within each cluster are summed to represent the new bus."
