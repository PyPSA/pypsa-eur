,Unit,Values,Description
mode,str,"One of {‘busmap’, ‘custom_busmap’, ‘administrative’}","‘busmap’: Default. ‘custom_busmap’: Enable the use of custom busmaps in rule mod:`cluster_network`. If activated the rule looks for provided busmaps at ``data/busmaps/base_s_{clusters}_{base_network}.csv`` which should have the same format as ``resources/busmap_base_s_{clusters}.csv``, i.e. the index should contain the buses of ``networks/base_s.nc``. {base_network} is the name of the selected base_network in electricity, e.g. ``gridkit``, ``osm-prebuilt``, or ``osm-raw``. ‘administrative’: Clusters and indexes the network based on the administrative regions of the countries based on ``nuts3_shapes.geojson``. To activate this, additionally set the ``clusters`` wildcard in ``scenario`` to ‘adm’."
focus_weights,,,"Optionally specify the focus weights for the clustering of countries. For instance: `DE: 0.8` will distribute 80% of all nodes to Germany and 20% to the rest of the countries. Only applies when mode is set to `busmap`."
administrative,,,
-- level,int,"{0, 1, 2, 3}","Level of administrative regions to cluster the network. 0: Country level, 1: NUTS1 level, 2: NUTS2 level, 3: NUTS3 level. Only applies when mode is set to `administrative`. Note that non-NUTS countries 'BA', 'MD', 'UA', and 'XK' can only be clustered to level 0 and 1."
-- countries (optional),dict,"Subset of country codes in ‘busmap’`","Optionally include dictionary of individual country codes and their individual NUTS levels. Overwrites country-specific `level`. For example: `{'DE': 1, 'FR': 2}`. Only applies when mode is set to `administrative`."
simplify_network,,,
-- to_substations,bool,"{'true','false'}","Aggregates all nodes without power injection (positive or negative, i.e. demand or generation) to electrically closest ones"
-- exclude_carriers,list,"List of Str like [ 'solar', 'onwind'] or empy list []","List of carriers which will not be aggregated. If empty, all carriers will be aggregated."
-- remove stubs,bool,"{'true','false'}",Controls whether radial parts of the network should be recursively aggregated. Defaults to true.
-- remove_stubs_across_borders,bool,"{'true','false'}",Controls whether radial parts of the network should be recursively aggregated across borders. Defaults to true.
cluster_network,,,
-- algorithm,str,"One of {‘kmeans’, ‘hac’}",
-- hac_features,list,"List of meteorological variables contained in the weather data cutout that should be considered for hierarchical clustering.",
exclude_carriers,list,"List of Str like [ 'solar', 'onwind'] or empy list []","List of carriers which will not be aggregated. If empty, all carriers will be aggregated."
consider_efficiency_classes,bool,"{'true','false'}","Aggregated each carriers into the top 10-quantile (high), the bottom 90-quantile (low), and everything in between (medium)."
aggregation_strategies,,,
-- generators,,,
-- -- {key},str,"{key} can be any of the component of the generator (str). It’s value can be any that can be converted to pandas.Series using getattr(). For example one of {min, max, sum}.","Aggregates the component according to the given strategy. For example, if sum, then all values within each cluster are summed to represent the new generator."
-- buses,,,
-- -- {key},str,"{key} can be any of the component of the bus (str). It’s value can be any that can be converted to pandas.Series using getattr(). For example one of {min, max, sum}.","Aggregates the component according to the given strategy. For example, if sum, then all values within each cluster are summed to represent the new bus."
temporal,,,Options for temporal resolution
-- resolution_elec,--,"{false,``nH``; i.e. ``2H``-``6H``}","Resample the time-resolution by averaging over every ``n`` snapshots in :mod:`prepare_network`. **Warning:** This option should currently only be used with electricity-only networks, not for sector-coupled networks."
-- resolution_sector,--,"{false,``nH``; i.e. ``2H``-``6H``}","Resample the time-resolution by averaging over every ``n`` snapshots in :mod:`prepare_sector_network`."
