-- H2,h,float,Maximum state of charge capacity of the hydrogen storage in terms of hours at full output capacity ``p_nom``. Cf. `PyPSA documentation <https://pypsa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/components.html#storage-unit>`_.
extendable_carriers,,,
-- Generator,--,Any extendable carrier,"Defines existing or non-existing conventional and renewable power plants to be extendable during the optimization. Conventional generators can only be built/expanded where already existent today. If a listed conventional carrier is not included in the ``conventional_carriers`` list, the lower limit of the capacity expansion is set to 0."
-- StorageUnit,--,"Any subset of {'battery','H2'}",Adds extendable storage units (battery and/or hydrogen) at every node/bus after clustering without capacity limits and with zero initial capacity.
-- Store,--,"Any subset of {'battery','H2'}",Adds extendable storage units (battery and/or hydrogen) at every node/bus after clustering without capacity limits and with zero initial capacity.
-- Link,--,Any subset of {'H2 pipeline'},Adds extendable links (H2 pipelines only) at every connection where there are lines or HVDC links without capacity limits and with zero initial capacity. Hydrogen pipelines require hydrogen storage to be modelled as ``Store``.

To be used in combination with ``extendable_carriers`` to allow for building conventional powerplants irrespective of existing locations."
,,,
conventional_carriers,--,"Any subset of {nuclear, oil, OCGT, CCGT, coal, lignite, geothermal, biomass}","List of conventional power plants to include in the model from ``resources/powerplants_s_{clusters}.csv``. If an included carrier is also listed in ``extendable_carriers``, the capacity is taken as a lower bound."

estimate_renewable_capacities,,,
-- enable,,bool,Activate routine to estimate renewable capacities in rule :mod:`add_electricity`. This option should not be used in combination with pathway planning ``foresight: myopic`` or ``foresight: perfect`` as renewable capacities are added differently in :mod:`add_existing_baseyear`.
-- from_opsd,--,bool,Add renewable capacities from `OPSD database <https://data.open-power-system-data.org/renewable_power_plants/2020-08-25>`_. The value is depreciated but still can be used.
