``Co2L``, Add an overall absolute carbon-dioxide emissions limit configured in ``electricity: co2limit``. If a float is appended an overall emission limit relative to the emission level given in ``electricity: co2base`` is added (e.g. ``Co2L0.05`` limits emissisions to 5% of what is given in ``electricity: co2base``), ``prepare_network``: `add_co2limit() <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/blob/6b964540ed39d44079cdabddee8333f486d0cd63/scripts/prepare_network.py#L19>`_ and its `caller <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/blob/6b964540ed39d44079cdabddee8333f486d0cd63/scripts/prepare_network.py#L154>`__, In active use
