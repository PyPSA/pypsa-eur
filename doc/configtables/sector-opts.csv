``Co2L`` + ``n``, Add an overall absolute carbon-dioxide emissions limit of ``n`` times of the 1990 base emissions (e.g. ``Co2L0.05`` limits emissisions to 5% of what is calculated in the rule :mod:``prepare_sector_network`` in the function ``co2_emissions_year()``),:mod:``prepare_sector_network`` in the function ``co2_emissions_year()`` , In active use
``carrier+component+{c|p|m|e}factor``,"Alter the capital cost (``c``), installable capacity potential (``p``), marginal costs (``m``) or installable storage potential (``e``) of components (``Generator``, ``Link``, etc.) with a given carrier by a factor. Example: ``solar+Generator+c0.5`` reduces the capital cost of solar generators to 50\% of original values.", ``prepare_network``, In active use
