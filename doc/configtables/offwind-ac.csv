,Unit,Values,Description
cutout,--,"Should be a folder listed in the configuration ``atlite: cutouts:`` (e.g. 'europe-2013-era5') or reference an existing folder in the directory ``cutouts``. Source module must be ERA5.","Specifies the directory where the relevant weather data ist stored."
resource,,,
-- method,--,"Must be 'wind'","A superordinate technology type."
-- turbine,--,"One of turbine types included in `atlite <https://github.com/PyPSA/atlite/tree/master/atlite/resources/windturbine>`_","Specifies the turbine type and its characteristic power curve."
capacity_per_sqkm,:math:`MW/km^2`,float,"Allowable density of wind turbine placement."
corine,--,"Any *realistic* subset of the `CORINE Land Cover code list <http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/corine-land-cover-2006-raster-1/corine-land-cover-classes-and/clc_legend.csv/at_download/file>`_","Specifies areas according to CORINE Land Cover codes which are generally eligible for AC-connected offshore wind turbine placement."
natura,bool,"{true, false}","Switch to exclude `Natura 2000 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natura_2000>`_ natural protection areas. Area is excluded if ``true``."
max_depth,m,float,"Maximum sea water depth at which wind turbines can be build. Maritime areas with deeper waters are excluded in the process of calculating the AC-connected offshore wind potential."
min_shore_distance,m,float,"Minimum distance to the shore below which wind turbines cannot be build. Such areas close to the shore are excluded in the process of calculating the AC-connected offshore wind potential."
potential,--,"One of {'simple', 'conservative'}","Method to compute the maximal installable potential for a node; confer :ref:`renewableprofiles`"
clip_p_max_pu,p.u.,float,"To avoid too small values in the renewables` per-unit availability time series values below this threshold are set to zero."
keep_all_available_areas,bool,"{'true', 'false'}","Use all availabe weather cells for renewable profile and potential generation. The default ignores weather cells where only less than 1 MW can be installed."
