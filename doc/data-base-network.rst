- **Description:** Pre-built data of high-voltage transmission grid in Europe from OpenStreetMap.

This dataset contains a topologically connected representation of the European
high-voltage grid (220 kV to 750 kV) constructed using OpenStreetMap data. Input data
was retrieved using the `Overpass turbo API <https://overpass-turbo.eu/>`__. A heurisitic
cleaning process was used to for lines and links where electrical parameters are
incomplete, missing, or ambiguous. Close substations within a radius of 500 m are
aggregated to single buses, exact locations of underlying substations is preserved.
Unique identifiers for lines and links are preserved.

A detailed explanation on the background, methodology, and validation of this dataset
can be found in `this paper <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2408.17178>`__ preprint
currently under peer-review.
