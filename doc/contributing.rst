We happily welcome anyone interested in contributing to this project,
be it with new ideas, suggestions, by filing bug reports or contributing code
to our `GitHub repository <https://github.com/PyPSA/PyPSA-Eur>`_.

* If you already have some code changes, you can submit them directly as a `pull request <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/pulls>`_.
* If you are wondering where we would greatly appreciate your efforts, check out the ``help wanted`` tag in the `issues list <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/issues>`_ and initiate a discussion there.
* If you start working on a feature in the code, let us know by opening an issue or a draft pull request.
  This helps all of us to keep an overview on what is being done and helps to avoid a situation where we
  are doing the same work twice in parallel.
* We encourage you to use the `PEP 8 coding style <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_.

For all code contributions we follow the four eyes principle (two person principle), i.e. all suggested code
including our own are reviewed by a second person before they are incoporated into our repository.

If you are unfamiliar with pull requests, the GitHub help pages have a nice `guide <https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests>`_.

To ask and answer general usage questions, join the `PyPSA and PyPSA-Eur mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pypsa>`_.
