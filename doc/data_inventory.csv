"jrc_enspreso_biomas",ENSPRESO biomass potentials for Europe,"This collection contains datasets from ENSPRESO2, an EU-28 wide, open dataset on renewable energy potentials, at national (NUTS0), regional and high-resolution (1 x 1 km and 5 x 5 km) levels for the 2010-2050 period. Within ENSPRESO, ENergy Systems Potential Renewable Energy SOurces, and the ENSPRESO2 updates, technical potentials are provided for wind, solar and biomass, based on coherent GIS-based land-restriction scenarios. [...] For biomass, agriculture, forestry and waste sectors are considered. The temporal resolution for wind and solar is both annual.","European Commission Joint Research Centre","https://data.jrc.ec.europa.eu/dataset/74ed5a04-7d74-4807-9eab-b94774309d9f",CC-BY-4.0
